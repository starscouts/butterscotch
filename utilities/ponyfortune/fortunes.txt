Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Hurry, friends! — Twilight Sparkle
Time for another adventure! — Twilight Sparkle
Adventure?! I'm in! — Rainbow Dash
Yee-hoo! Let's go, ponies! — Applejack
Earth ponies, take the lead! — Twilight Sparkle
Whoo-hoo! — Pinkie Pie
Pegasi, fly beside me! Unicorns, horns at the ready! — Twilight Sparkle
What fantastical foe awaits us, princess? — Rarity
Is it something... scary? — Fluttershy
Or is it something awesome?! — Rainbow Dash
No matter what it is, we'll face it together. For we are the Guardians of Friendship! With the power of our friendship and magic, we will... — Twilight Sparkle
Spread love! — Pinkie Pie
Give hugs! — Fluttershy
Fry brains! — Rarity
Huh? — Fluttershy
Wait, what? — Twilight Sparkle
Yeah! I'm a unicorn, and we're evil! I'm gonna zap everypony with my horn lasers! — Rarity
What?! No! No, no no, it's all— — Twilight Sparkle
—wrong! The ponies are all supposed to get along, remember? — Young Sunny Starscout
It's like in the olden times when all three pony kinds were friends. — Young Sunny Starscout
And they never used their magic against each other. — Young Sunny Starscout
No, I'm not! — Young Sunny Starscout
They wouldn't do that! — Young Sunny Starscout
Those are lies! Hitch, tell him! — Young Sunny Starscout
Well, uh, that is kinda what our teacher said in history class. But... — Young Hitch Trailblazer
But, hey, oh, we can play the game your way if you want, Sunny. I don't mind. — Young Hitch Trailblazer
Sprout, stop it! — Young Sunny Starscout
I'm gonna tell my dad! — Young Sunny Starscout
You're going to break them! — Young Sunny Starscout
Take that, Earth pony! Pew-pew! — Young Hitch Trailblazer
Dad, tell them that's not what they do! — Young Sunny Starscout
How does that feel? Pew-pew! — Young Hitch Trailblazer
Time to head on home, don't you think, colts? — Argyle Starshine
Oh, no! My brains are melting! — Young Hitch Trailblazer
And why is that again, Phyllis? — Argyle Starshine
It's called research, Phyllis. And by the way, I leave all the brainwashing in Maretime Bay to you. Unicorn cupcake? — Argyle Starshine
Freshly baked! — Young Sunny Starscout
Mmm! — Young Sunny Starscout
What's the matter, Sunny Bunny? — Argyle Starshine
Hitch and Sprout still don't believe me. — Young Sunny Starscout
Maybe one day they will. But the important thing is that you stand up for what you believe in, okay? — Argyle Starshine
Well, when I grow up, I'm going to show everypony that we are right. — Young Sunny Starscout
Oh? — Argyle Starshine
Yeah! And someday, the both of us will meet unicorns or a Pegasus, and we'll be best friends forever! — Young Sunny Starscout
Well, maybe today is that day. Look! A unicorn! — Argyle Starshine
Where?! Where?! — Young Sunny Starscout
Over here! — Argyle Starshine
Hold on! — Argyle Starshine
Wheeee! I'm soaring through the sky! — Young Sunny Starscout
Whoo! Yee-haw! — Argyle Starshine
Wait! Dad! I have an idea! — Young Sunny Starscout
"Dear unicorns and Pegasi, you have friends in Maretime Bay. Come visit us." — Argyle Starshine
Can we send it? — Young Sunny Starscout
I think it's our duty. — Argyle Starshine
Can you tell me the story? — Young Sunny Starscout
Again? — Argyle Starshine
Pleeeeease? — Young Sunny Starscout
Once upon a time, many, many moons ago, in ancient Equestria, there lived a very special— — Argyle Starshine
Unicorn! — Young Sunny Starscout
The unicorn was very bright... — Argyle Starshine
As bright as the sun. — Young Sunny Starscout
One day, the princess summoned her to the castle for an important assignment. — Argyle Starshine
To learn about friendship! — Young Sunny Starscout
Mm-hmm. She soon made lots of new friends. — Argyle Starshine
Earth ponies, Pegasuses, and unicorns! — Young Sunny Starscout
Together, they showed everypony the Magic of Friendship and how to live in harmony. — Argyle Starshine
Wow! You finished it! — Young Sunny Starscout
Pretty neat, huh? Earth ponies watched in wonder as Pegasi painted rainbows across the sky. The nights were lit up by a hundred unicorn horns. — Argyle Starshine
It's beautiful. — Young Sunny Starscout
I wish I had a friend who could fly around or float things. Why can't we be friends anymore? — Young Sunny Starscout
That, my darling, is a big question. And maybe one day, we'll figure it out. Together. We'll do our part... — Argyle Starshine
Goodnight, Daddy. — Young Sunny Starscout
Goodnight, my little pony. — Argyle Starshine
Goodnight, friends. — Young Sunny Starscout
Perfect. — Sunny Starscout
Today's the day, Dad. I actually have a plan this time. Wish me luck! — Sunny Starscout
Aha! There you are, Sunny. Just the pony I was expecting. — Hitch Trailblazer
Morning, Sheriff Hitch. I see you brought the whole squad along again. — Sunny Starscout
What is it with me and critters? I'm like a magnet to them. Guys, come on. Give Hitch a little space. — Hitch Trailblazer
So, what's up? — Sunny Starscout
Oh, please. Like you don't know. Today is the annual presentation at Canterlogic. — Hitch Trailblazer
Hey, I'm headed there right now. — Sunny Starscout
Uh, no, you're not. Listen, I know that you have come up with some harebrained scheme to sabotage it, and if you think I'm just gonna let you walk in there— — Hitch Trailblazer
Hey, Hitch... — Sunny Starscout
No. — Hitch Trailblazer
Come on. — Sunny Starscout
Morning, Mayflower, Dahlia. Sunny, I'm on duty. — Hitch Trailblazer
Okay? — Hitch Trailblazer
Oh, hey, Sprout. You okay? You seem kinda wheezy. — Sunny Starscout
Hey! W-Wait up! I'm not finished! Sunny! Sunny, we both know how this goes. Every year you try to sneak in, and every year I stop you. — Hitch Trailblazer
Look, you have nothing to worry about. I'll just go into the factory, deliver my smoothies— — Sunny Starscout
But I... — Sunny Starscout
I'm asking you as your friend, Sunny, not as sheriff. Just please try not to pull any stunts today. — Hitch Trailblazer
Okay, okay. I'll try. — Sunny Starscout
Thank you. Now, give your delivery to Sprout and go home. — Hitch Trailblazer
Hey, hey! That's a violation of Code 33! — Hitch Trailblazer
You know what, Sprout? I think I finally got through to Sunny. — Hitch Trailblazer
Yikes. That's gonna be a lot of paperwork. — Hitch Trailblazer
Earth ponies of Maretime Bay! Fear is not your friend! But the unicorns and Pegasi can be! Let's extend the hoof of friendship! — Sunny Starscout
Wha—? That is not what I meant. — Sunny Starscout
Peace with Pegasi! Ah! Unity with— ah! —unicorns! — Sunny Starscout
Hey! Gimme that back! Ow! — Sunny Starscout
Sunny. — Hitch Trailblazer
Peace with... Pegasi! — Sunny Starscout
Whoa! — Sunny Starscout
Toots! Sweets! Shut her down! Sheriff's orders! — Hitch Trailblazer
Huh? — Sunny Starscout
Oh, no. Whoa! Peace with Pegasi! Unity with unicorns! — Sunny Starscout
<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">cease fire!</span> — Sunny Starscout
Aren't you tired of being scared all the time? The truth is we're not in danger. It's all a lie. We don't need any of this Canterlogic junk. — Sunny Starscout
Just imagine if you had a friend who could fly or a friend who could— — Sunny Starscout
All right, Sunny. Let's go. — Hitch Trailblazer
No! Everypony needs to hear this! Everything you believe about Pegasi and unicorns is wrong! They used to be our friends and can be again! — Sunny Starscout
Come on, let's go. Show's over, Sunny. — Hitch Trailblazer
Do you have any idea how many bylaws you broke in there?! — Hitch Trailblazer
I'm sure you're about to tell me. — Sunny Starscout
Actually, for once I can't! Because there's so many! I tried to warn you. I can't keep associating with some pony who breaks every rule and causes chaos wherever she goes. I'm the sheriff! — Hitch Trailblazer
Exactly! Other ponies look up to you! You can help! — Sunny Starscout
The law is the law, Sunny, and I'm here to uphold it and keep everypony safe. — Hitch Trailblazer
Aha! You just said "everypony". That includes Pegasi and unicorns. — Sunny Starscout
Come on, Sunny, what did you think was gonna happen? You give a little speech and what? Everypony just magically welcomes unicorns and Pegasi into Maretime Bay? You keep saying there's nothing to be afraid of. Well, then, prove it. All of that pony unity stuff was just a foal's bedtime story made up by your dad. Like it or not, this is the way it is and always will be. I'm the last real friend you got in this town. You really want to lose me, too? — Hitch Trailblazer
I wish you were here, Dad. — Sunny Starscout
What the...? — Sunny Starscout
What's going on? What's happening? Ugh! — Sunny Starscout
Hi, new friend! My name's Izzy! — Izzy Moonbow
U... U... Unicorn! — Sunny Starscout
Ooh, is everypony playing hide-and-seek? I see you! — Izzy Moonbow
Hey, what's going on? Unicorn attaaaaaaaack! — Hitch Trailblazer
This is not a drill! I repeat – this is not! A! Drill! A vulnerable young pony! Gotcha! Your son is safe now, ma'am. — Hitch Trailblazer
You're welcome! Man the Splat-a-pult! Activate the unicorn trap! Pick up that litter! — Hitch Trailblazer
Wow! Is that the sea? I've never seen the sea! — Izzy Moonbow
I've gotta get you out of here! — Sunny Starscout
Earth ponies are serious about games. — Izzy Moonbow
They're not playing! They're terrified! — Sunny Starscout
Oh, no! Of what? — Izzy Moonbow
You! You're a unicorn! Earth ponies hate unicorns! — Sunny Starscout
Really? That seems a little harsh. — Izzy Moonbow
Let's go! — Sunny Starscout
Whee! — Izzy Moonbow
Ooh, I haven't seen this one yet. — Izzy Moonbow
All right, citizens, calm down. The threat has been neutralized. The unicorn has been captured. You may now cheer. — Hitch Trailblazer
Sunny! What are you doing? Don't even think about it. No, don't you dare. No, no, no, no! — Hitch Trailblazer
Sunny! — Hitch Trailblazer
So, your name's Sunny? — Izzy Moonbow
Bye! It was nice to meet you all! — Izzy Moonbow
Deputy, to the lighthouse! — Hitch Trailblazer
You gotta be kidding me... — Hitch Trailblazer
Do Earth ponies also like staring contests? Hmmmmmmmmm... Ah! You win! I blinked! — Izzy Moonbow
There's... a unicorn... in my house... This is so cool! Wait, no, it's bad. Very, very bad. What have I done? — Sunny Starscout
Wow! I've never seen an Earth pony before. We look exactly the same! Except for this, of course. — Izzy Moonbow
Whoa! Hey! Be careful where you point that thing. — Sunny Starscout
Why? — Izzy Moonbow
Well, I, uh... um... sorta don't want to get zapped with a wayward laser beam. But of course you know that already. You've probably been reading my mind this whole time. Isn't it supposed to glow, by the way? Or does that only happen when you levitate stuff? — Sunny Starscout
Well, actually... — Izzy Moonbow
Wait! Don't answer that yet. Let me get my notebook! Okay, wow. Okay. "A hundred forty-two questions for a unicorn". Question number one - where do you live? — Sunny Starscout
Bridlewood. — Izzy Moonbow
I knew it! Do unicorns really live in trees? Do they eat pizza? If so, what toppings do they like? If not, why not? Can you actually fry pony brains with a single horn zap? Can you make this float? — Sunny Starscout
No... but I can do this. — Izzy Moonbow
Ta-daaaaa! — Izzy Moonbow
Wait. You don't have any magic? — Sunny Starscout
Sunny Starscout! — Hitch Trailblazer
Argh, that hurt. Sunny Starscout, I know you're in there with that unicorn! Come out with your hooves up and surrender! — Hitch Trailblazer
Will you let me do my job? You are under arrest! — Hitch Trailblazer
This is bad. How sneaky are you? — Sunny Starscout
Uh, medium sneaky? — Izzy Moonbow
I can work with that. Okay, I'll distract them. — Sunny Starscout
Oh, pffft. Relax. I'll talk to them. — Izzy Moonbow
Wha—? N-No, no! — Sunny Starscout
Hi, guys! Now, I know what you're thinking. — Izzy Moonbow
W-What are you doing? Where are you going? — Hitch Trailblazer
We have reinforcements? Huh? Oh, come on! — Hitch Trailblazer
You don't have any magic? — Sunny Starscout
Nope. — Izzy Moonbow
No magic? — Sunny Starscout
Oh, but if it makes you feel any better, we did have it, but that was many, many, many moons ago. It just – poof – disappeared. Everypony thinks the pesky Pegasi had something to do with it, but... O-Oh. Hey, you look like kinda woozy. Are you okay? — Izzy Moonbow
Huh. I am on the run with a unicorn who has no magic. What are we gonna do? — Sunny Starscout
What are you doing? — Sunny Starscout
You don't smell. — Izzy Moonbow
Thanks. Wait, what? — Sunny Starscout
I was told all you Earth ponies smell like rotten sardines, but you do not. Hmm. — Izzy Moonbow
What else do unicorns say about Earth ponies? — Sunny Starscout
Oh, just that you're lazy and not the brightest crystals in the forest. — Izzy Moonbow
Charming. — Sunny Starscout
Nope, just those three. So, what's the plan? — Izzy Moonbow
Wait. I've got it! Izzy, we're going on a quest... to Zephyr Heights. — Sunny Starscout
The Pegasus city? — Izzy Moonbow
Yes. We need to find out what happened to your magic and bring it back. They have magic. Maybe they can help. — Sunny Starscout
Uh, but the Pegasi are bad news. — Izzy Moonbow
What if you're wrong about them? Earth ponies were wrong about unicorns. They could welcome us with open wings. — Sunny Starscout
But what if they don't? — Izzy Moonbow
I told her. I told her. No more favors. No more bailing her out. She gave me no choice. No choice! All right. We need to arrest her and bring her back to face the full force of the law. — Hitch Trailblazer
You and I. — Hitch Trailblazer
You know what? I think you're right. This one's a job for Hitch and Hitch only. — Hitch Trailblazer
All right. Sprout, you stay here while I'm out dancing with danger. Keep everypony calm, maintain the peace, be a pillar of strength. Who am I kidding? Just try not to start a war while I'm gone, okay? — Hitch Trailblazer
You know, not to freak you out or anything, but you do know Pegasi can steal your luminescence, right? — Izzy Moonbow
My lumi-what? — Sunny Starscout
Luminescence. You know, like, your sparkle? Yours is... lavender. — Izzy Moonbow
Huh? — Sunny Starscout
And the happier you are, the brighter it shines! — Izzy Moonbow
Hurry! — Sunny Starscout
Whoa! — Izzy Moonbow
Whoa! — Izzy Moonbow
Aah! — Sunny Starscout
Sunny! — Izzy Moonbow
A real Pegasus...! — Sunny Starscout
Whoa! A unicorn? And an Earth pony? Together?! Okay, well, this day just got a whole lot more interesting. — Zipp Storm
Don't tell them you saw me! — Zipp Storm
There's no way we cooooould! We don't even know your naaaaame! — Izzy Moonbow
She seems nice. — Izzy Moonbow
That's creative. — Izzy Moonbow
What's it like to fly? Is your wingspan the same as your height? — Sunny Starscout
Do you need a license to fly? How far can you go? — Sunny Starscout
Can you fly to the moon? — Izzy Moonbow
Do Pegasi wear horseshoes, or do they just weigh you down? — Sunny Starscout
Royal celebration?! Talk about great timing! — Izzy Moonbow
What is up, everypony? Big shout out to all my fans, the Pippsqueaks! — Pipp Petals
So, tonight's the night. I can't wait to debut my new song later. It has a very special place in my heart, but not as much as you guys! — Pipp Petals
Okay, guys, I love you lots. Gotta go. Pipp-Pipp-hooray! — Pipp Petals
You betcha. — Izzy Moonbow
Do you see anypony flying here? — Sunny Starscout
They have a castle! — Izzy Moonbow
Wow! — Izzy Moonbow
Your Majesty! — Izzy Moonbow
Hi, new friend! — Izzy Moonbow
Check it out, Pippsqueaks! Live from the castle... it's a real unicorn and Earth pony! — Pipp Petals
I know, right? This is so not a filter. — Pipp Petals
Excuse me, Majesty? Um, we only want to ask you a few questions about magic. We— — Sunny Starscout
What? N-No, no! But-but, your Majesty, I just wanted to ask you a few questions, please! — Sunny Starscout
Did she just say "dungeons"? — Izzy Moonbow
What else could go wrong today? — Sunny Starscout
Something is not right. We haven't seen a single pony flying, except the royal family. Izzy, are you listening? — Sunny Starscout
This isn't dungeon-y at all. Uh-h-h-h... — Izzy Moonbow
Hey! — Zipp Storm
Huh? — Izzy Moonbow
I'm sorry you two got thrown in here, but I have to talk to you. — Zipp Storm
Princess? — Sunny Starscout
Your Majesticness! Y-Your Graceful Highness! — Izzy Moonbow
Zipp. Just... call me Zipp. — Zipp Storm
Okay, Zipp. I'm Sunny. And this is my friend. — Sunny Starscout
Izzy Moonbow. — Izzy Moonbow
Sunny, Izzy, I really need to ask you something important... ...about magic. — Zipp Storm
That's why we're here. Maybe you can tell us how yours works? Izzy has no idea how the unicorns lost theirs, so we thought maybe— — Sunny Starscout
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Lost theirs? As in no magic? Well... that changes things. Listen, I might have some information that could help, but first, you need to tell me about this. — Zipp Storm
My journal! Thank you, Zipp. I-I never thought I'd see it again. — Sunny Starscout
Yeah, I can be pretty sneaky when I want to be. — Zipp Storm
Nice. I'm-I'm only medium sneaky. — Izzy Moonbow
So where did that come from? — Zipp Storm
It was my father's. Why? — Sunny Starscout
That star... — Zipp Storm
Zipp, what are you doing here? Mom said to stay away. — Pipp Petals
Right. Then why are you here? — Zipp Storm
For the content. — Pipp Petals
Princess, why isn't anypony flying? — Sunny Starscout
Everypony knows that only royals can fly, of course. — Pipp Petals
I know, it's not fair. But that's just the way it is. If there were some way we could teach the citizens to fly, you know we would in a wing beat. Right, Zipp? — Pipp Petals
Yeah. In a wing beat. — Zipp Storm
Oh! Dress rehearsals. Gotta go. And so should you. Me-me-meeeee! Red feather, yellow feather, red feather, yellow feather. — Pipp Petals
I have to show you something. — Zipp Storm
You comin' or what? — Zipp Storm
Huh? — Hitch Trailblazer
Litter! I mean, a clue. Hmmm... Unicorn hair. Pegasi. Track's gone cold. Sunny, Sunny, Sunny, Sunny. You think you've escaped? Well, think again. I will not eat! I will not sleep! Well, maybe a quick nap and snack if I can't find you in the next few hours, BUT! After that, nothing will stop me! — Hitch Trailblazer
Oh. Thank you. Thank you. No, no, you're too kind. ALSO! — Hitch Trailblazer
I'll follow you wherever you go! Whether harshest deserts, the coldest tundras, no trail too dangerous, no clue too small! — Hitch Trailblazer
The past matters not! It's justice— What? What? — Hitch Trailblazer
Gotcha. — Hitch Trailblazer
Watch your step. — Zipp Storm
Oof! — Sunny Starscout
Whoa! — Izzy Moonbow
Where are we? — Sunny Starscout
It's amazing, right? I'm pretty sure it was some sort of station for when Earth ponies and unicorns used to visit Zephyr Heights. It's like everypony just... forgot. — Zipp Storm
This is proof! All pony kinds did used to be friends! My dad was right. It must be really weird being the only Pegasi that can fly. — Sunny Starscout
The truth is we can't fly either. We've been faking it. — Zipp Storm
Faking it?! But... but how? — Sunny Starscout
You'd be surprised what some wires and good lighting will do. But I'm just so tired of living that ridiculous lie. That's why I come down here – to get away from all of that. And, well... to do this. — Zipp Storm
Wow! — Sunny Starscout
Whoa! Her sparkle is so bright right now! — Izzy Moonbow
But that's not why I brought you down here. This is what I wanted to show you. — Zipp Storm
Oh, my stars...! — Sunny Starscout
This was made a long, long time ago, when we still had magic. — Zipp Storm
It's beautiful! — Izzy Moonbow
What is that? — Sunny Starscout
That's the Pegasus Crystal. It's part of my mom's crown. — Zipp Storm
Hmmm. Where's the Unicorn Crystal? Look! — Sunny Starscout
They fit? — Izzy Moonbow
These two crystals belong together. United. — Sunny Starscout
So... what are you saying? — Zipp Storm
Maybe you lost your magic because the crystals were separated. — Sunny Starscout
So if we put them back together... — Izzy Moonbow
...magic will return? — Zipp Storm
And all three pony kinds will get along again! — Sunny Starscout
All right! — Zipp Storm
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho! — Izzy Moonbow
Aw, but what about the Unicorn Crystal? — Zipp Storm
Well, if you're looking for crystals, we've got, like, a gazillion of them back in Bridlewood. — Izzy Moonbow
Then that's where we'll go next. After we get the Pegasus Crystal from your mom, of course. — Sunny Starscout
Ooh... That'll be tricky. She, uh, never takes her crown off. — Zipp Storm
So, what do we do? — Sunny Starscout
I got it! Pipp's performing at tonight's royal celebration. All eyes will be on her, especially my mom's. She'll be distracted. So we just need to swap the real crown with a fake. — Zipp Storm
Oooh, I can craft a decoy! But I will need a box of macaroni, a tube of glue, fourteen gooey bunnies, and three jelly beans. Oh. And glitter. Lots of glitter. — Izzy Moonbow
I'll get the supplies. I'll pass them off to Sunny, and then she will get them to you. Once you produce the decoy, get your flanks to the palace. Everypony who's anypony will be there, so security will be tight. — Zipp Storm
I'll distract them... — Zipp Storm
...so you can sneak in. — Zipp Storm
Maximum sneaky! — Izzy Moonbow
You'll need to be stealthy. Carefully make your way to the Grand Hall, but watch out for the guards. — Zipp Storm
I'll open the door to the backstage of the throne room. — Zipp Storm
And once Pipp starts singing, my mom will be so caught up that swapping the crowns will be easy-breezy. — Zipp Storm
Easy-breezy. Sure. — Sunny Starscout
Pipp told you? — Zipp Storm
Actually, there is something I wanted to tell you. The unicorns don't have any magic. I-I think it's tied to why we can't fly, and I— — Zipp Storm
Because it's a lie! — Zipp Storm
Me-me-meeeee! — Pipp Petals
Ugh. — Zipp Storm
Aah! — Sunny Starscout
Sunny Starscout, you are under arrest—! — Hitch Trailblazer
No! — Sunny Starscout
Give... it... to... me! — Zipp Storm
No, no, no! Shhh! Shhh! — Sunny Starscout
Quiet! — Izzy Moonbow
Huh? — Hitch Trailblazer
It's okay, don't be scared! — Sunny Starscout
I'm not gonna fry your brain, okay? — Izzy Moonbow
What the...? — Pipp Petals
Huh? — Hitch Trailblazer
Uhhh... — Hitch Trailblazer
What is happening? — Pipp Petals
Uhhh... — Hitch Trailblazer
Whoooaaaa! — Pipp Petals
I got it! — Zipp Storm
Yes! — Sunny Starscout
Let's go! — Zipp Storm
Freeze! — Hitch Trailblazer
Whoa! — Pipp Petals
Ugh! — Pipp Petals
Uh... — Pipp Petals
Zipp...? — Pipp Petals
Zipp, hurry! — Sunny Starscout
Quick, this way! — Zipp Storm
Okay. I think we lost 'em. — Hitch Trailblazer
Hitch, what are you even doing here? — Sunny Starscout
Arresting you. And saving you. So, you know, a little of both actually. You're welcome! — Hitch Trailblazer
Oh-ho-ho, gee, thanks. But we don't need any saving, okay? — Zipp Storm
And you are? — Hitch Trailblazer
Her mom is the queen! — Izzy Moonbow
Wait a minute. So that means... you're a princess? — Hitch Trailblazer
Huh. Look at that. The sheriff just became a detective. — Zipp Storm
What? — Hitch Trailblazer
Anypony care to explain? — Hitch Trailblazer
We had to get the crystal. Look. Oh, no, no, no, no! It's not here! — Sunny Starscout
Seriously?! — Zipp Storm
On the bright side, we had so much losing it. — Izzy Moonbow
We have to go back! — Sunny Starscout
But it could be anywhere! — Zipp Storm
Somepony seriously needs to explain why this thing was so important that you had to ruin my whole show over it! — Pipp Petals
Trust me. It was. — Zipp Storm
You left me hanging there! In the spotlight! Now everypony knows we can't fly. — Pipp Petals
What?! This is not happening! This is so not happening! — Pipp Petals
Pipp! Forget about all that. We think we can bring back magic, but we need that crystal. — Zipp Storm
Have you lost your mind? — Pipp Petals
Please. This might be our only chance. — Zipp Storm
Ugh! Fine! I know a way out. Come on. — Pipp Petals
What? Wait! You can't just... But I'm a sheriff! — Hitch Trailblazer
That's the tree from the map. That means... it's this way. — Sunny Starscout
What am I even doing here? Hoofing it across daisy fields, looking for a magical crystal that doesn't even exist! — Hitch Trailblazer
It was supposed to be my best show ever. And now it's all over. I'm a criminal! And it's all because of... — Pipp Petals
And that is so not cool. — Pipp Petals
No, it is not. Did I just agree with a Pegasus? — Hitch Trailblazer
Hey! Are you sure she even knows where to find this other crystal? — Pipp Petals
Don't you trust me at all? — Zipp Storm
I don't know. You are the one that just got Mom thrown in jail! — Pipp Petals
Look, once we get our magic back, the whole kingdom will be so excited, they won't even remember what happened back there. You'll be a hero, Pipp. — Zipp Storm
Let's get one thing straight. — Hitch Trailblazer
We're almost to the river, everypony! — Sunny Starscout
After this whole escapade is over with, you are gonna march back home to Maretime Bay with me. Is that clear? — Hitch Trailblazer
Crystal. — Sunny Starscout
Great. Because this badge means that I'm the she— No, no, no, no, no! Where's my badge?! Hey! You! — Hitch Trailblazer
Hmm? — Izzy Moonbow
I know unicorns like shiny things! — Hitch Trailblazer
Oh, you know, I think I did see a shiny badge-y thing on the ground a few hours ago. — Izzy Moonbow
What?! Hours?! — Hitch Trailblazer
Well, maybe it's for the best. Between you and me, buddy, that badge was creating an unhealthy power dynamic. — Izzy Moonbow
What are we gonna do? — Sunny Starscout
Any ideas, Zipp? — Pipp Petals
You know what would be great right now? Let me think. Maybe something like... <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">the ability to fly!</span> — Zipp Storm
You know what would be even better? Not being stuck in the middle of nowhere as <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">outcasts from our own kingdom!</span> — Pipp Petals
Oh, well. That's the end of that. Time to go home. I wish I could say it was nice meeting all of you, but it wasn't. Come on, Sunny. — Hitch Trailblazer
I don't think so! — Pipp Petals
Everypony, stop! We're gonna get to the other side, find the crystal, and bring back magic! And once we do, you'll get to fly, you'll get your fans back, and you'll have me in custody! Everypony happy now?! — Sunny Starscout
Ta-daaaaa! — Izzy Moonbow
All right! — Zipp Storm
Ah, great. — Hitch Trailblazer
Come on, everypony! — Sunny Starscout
Oh, yeah! Nailed it! — Izzy Moonbow
Come on, stupid stick. — Hitch Trailblazer
You need some backup, sheriff? — Zipp Storm
No! Thank you. I've got it. Come on... If only I had a match... — Hitch Trailblazer
Hah! — Hitch Trailblazer
Oh, well, that was sad to watch. Come on, don't be a hero, dude. Come get warm. — Zipp Storm
Are you sure about all this? Because if we just go back to Maretime Bay... — Hitch Trailblazer
What have we got to lose? — Sunny Starscout
By giving magic back to our enemies? Uh, let me think. I know – a lot! — Hitch Trailblazer
Come on. Do they look like enemies to you? — Sunny Starscout
My sparkle is aquamarine? That's, like, my sixth favorite color! — Pipp Petals
I don't know. Maybe I should just go back to Maretime Bay where I'm needed. — Hitch Trailblazer
If that's what you want. But you should know I'm actually glad you're here, Hitch. We all are. — Sunny Starscout
Ugh. — Hitch Trailblazer
So I think we should set off at first light. Last stop – Bridlewood. What's wrong, Izzy? — Sunny Starscout
It's just that... being with you ponies has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. I guess... I just don't want our adventure to end. — Izzy Moonbow
But, Izzy, you'll get your magic. — Sunny Starscout
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come to Maretime Bay? — Hitch Trailblazer
I always wanted to visit. When I was a filly, I found this pretty lantern. It had a message inside. It said I had friends in Maretime Bay. It... It was you! — Izzy Moonbow
I made it with my dad. We always promised each other that someday we would prove that all ponies were meant to be friends. We'll do our part. Hoof to heart. — Sunny Starscout
Hey, um... I want to do my part. What have we got to lose, right? — Hitch Trailblazer
I have to admit. A unicorn forest does sound kind of magical. — Hitch Trailblazer
Or not. — Hitch Trailblazer
Come on! My house isn't far from here! — Izzy Moonbow
Well, here we are, guys. — Izzy Moonbow
La villa Izzy! — Izzy Moonbow
Did you make all of this? — Zipp Storm
Yup! "Uni-cycling"! Isn't it funky? — Izzy Moonbow
It is gorgeoooous! — Pipp Petals
I also make friendship bracelets! — Izzy Moonbow
Ah, cool. — Zipp Storm
Wait, wait! Watch this! Hold everything! Aah! I've never gotten to use this with actual friends! — Izzy Moonbow
Ta-daaaa! — Izzy Moonbow
Whoa! — Zipp Storm
I so wish I had live-streamed that! — Pipp Petals
We don't have time for that right now. If we're gonna get the information we need on the Unicorn Crystal, we can't stick out like sore hooves. We need to look like unicorns. — Sunny Starscout
Yay, makeovers! I love makeovers! — Pipp Petals
No. No, this is not... This is not what I signed up for. No. — Zipp Storm
So, Izzy, can you do it? — Sunny Starscout
A glow-up? — Izzy Moonbow
Honey, you came to the right cottage. — Izzy Moonbow
Ta-daaaaa! Crystals! Crystals! Crystals! — Izzy Moonbow
She does know we're just looking for the one, right? — Zipp Storm
Crystals! Crystals! Crystals! — Izzy Moonbow
Well, this is... cheerful. — Hitch Trailblazer
These other unicorns seem so different from you. — Sunny Starscout
Yeah, I get that a lot. My sparkle is a bit too sparkly for Bridlewood. — Izzy Moonbow
How can we tell which ones are magic? — Hitch Trailblazer
Huh? — Hitch Trailblazer
Ooooookay... I'm gonna need some context. — Zipp Storm
Unicorns are very superstitious. If a pony ever says a forbidden word, we have to do a ritual to ward off the jinxies. — Izzy Moonbow
Jinxies? — Pipp Petals
Bad luck. — Izzy Moonbow
Forbidden words? — Hitch Trailblazer
"Magic", "wing", "feather"... Oh, and "mayonnaise". — Izzy Moonbow
What's wrong with may—? — Hitch Trailblazer
Come on! There's something I want to show you. — Izzy Moonbow
The Crystal Tea Room? — Sunny Starscout
There's a pony inside who collects crystals. Maybe he could help us. — Izzy Moonbow
That's great, Izzy! Oh, and Hitch? — Sunny Starscout
I know, I know. No forbidden words. — Hitch Trailblazer
That's the pony I was talking about. — Izzy Moonbow
So word in the forest is you collect crystals. — Sunny Starscout
Oh, no. — Izzy Moonbow
Who's Alphabittle? — Sunny Starscout
There it is! I've got an idea. Maybe I can beat Alphabittle at his own game. — Sunny Starscout
Wait. Alphabittle can smell fear. — Izzy Moonbow
Got it. Okay. Be cool. — Sunny Starscout
Tea. — Sunny Starscout
Hold the milk. Quite the game player, I see. — Sunny Starscout
I don't play. I win. — Sunny Starscout
Yeah, it is. And I challenge you... for that! — Sunny Starscout
Only one way to find out. — Sunny Starscout
I think you'll find I'm average height. Tick-tock. What do you say? — Sunny Starscout
Special enough for ya? — Sunny Starscout
Um, what are you doing? — Zipp Storm
Don't worry. I could solve that cube puzzle in my sleep. — Sunny Starscout
But if he wins, we'll lose both crystals. — Pipp Petals
He won't. Trust me. — Sunny Starscout
Deal. Now give me that cube. — Sunny Starscout
The ultimate what now? — Sunny Starscout
A dancing game. Seriously? — Sunny Starscout
I-It's okay. You're just warming up. — Izzy Moonbow
Focus. — Sunny Starscout
Ohhh. Here goes nothing. — Sunny Starscout
Hey. You hear that, Sunny? Feel the rhythm take you over. You feelin' it? — Pipp Petals
Oh, I'm feelin' it. I'm feelin' it! — Sunny Starscout
Yeah, you are, Sunny! Yeah, you do this, Sunny! Whoo! — Pipp Petals
Yes! She's doin' it, she's doin' it! — Hitch Trailblazer
We won. — Sunny Starscout
We won! We actually won! — Sunny Starscout
And Pegasi! — Zipp Storm
And a unicorn! Which... you knew already! — Izzy Moonbow
I know it doesn't look like it, but we're here to help. — Sunny Starscout
But I won. — Sunny Starscout
Uh... Magic! Wing! Feather! MAYONNAISE!!! — Hitch Trailblazer
Go, go, go! — Sunny Starscout
Sorry about that! Uh, thanks for the tea! — Izzy Moonbow
You escaped! — Zipp Storm
How did you find us? — Pipp Petals
Aah! — Hitch Trailblazer
Ah! My badge! Yes! — Hitch Trailblazer
Uh... — Izzy Moonbow
Let us explain! — Sunny Starscout
<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">nopony has magic!</span> — Sunny Starscout
But we're here to bring it back. — Sunny Starscout
I know it sounds unbelievable, but please, just let us try. — Sunny Starscout
Please, Mom. — Pipp Petals
Trust us. — Zipp Storm
Ready, Izzy? — Sunny Starscout
Ready. — Izzy Moonbow
It... It... — Sunny Starscout
We can try it again! Maybe... Maybe w-we did it wrong somehow. Wait. Wait, don't go. Oh, come on. Work. Work! Please work! Come on! — Sunny Starscout
Sunny. It's okay. You did everything you could. — Hitch Trailblazer
I... I thought it would work. I was so, so sure of it. — Sunny Starscout
What do we do now, Sunny? — Zipp Storm
I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused you. — Sunny Starscout
Sunny! We can't give up! — Pipp Petals
I thought that I could make a difference. But everywhere I go, I just make things worse. — Sunny Starscout
That's not true. We're all in this together, right? — Izzy Moonbow
Yeah. — Pipp Petals
Of course. — Zipp Storm
I'm so sorry I let you all down. — Sunny Starscout
I guess this is goodbye... friends. — Hitch Trailblazer
Better hurry... sheriff. — Zipp Storm
I'm right here if you need to talk, Sunny. — Hitch Trailblazer
Sunny! — Hitch Trailblazer
Hitch! Hitch! I figured it out! There's actually a third—! — Sunny Starscout
Huh? Hey, w-wait. What is going on here? — Hitch Trailblazer
Official Sprout what? — Hitch Trailblazer
Sprout! What are you doing? — Hitch Trailblazer
Ugh. Wait, wait, no, Sprout, listen to me. Listen to me. The Pegasi and unicorns can be our friends. There's no need to be afraid of them. Besides, they don't even have any magic. — Hitch Trailblazer
But we can bring magic back! Bring friendship back! — Sunny Starscout
We have to warn them! — Sunny Starscout
Sunny! — Izzy Moonbow
What are you guys doing here? — Sunny Starscout
We don't care what anypony says! — Izzy Moonbow
Yeah! We just want to stay friends! — Zipp Storm
You're all in danger! — Sunny Starscout
We have to stop that thing! — Zipp Storm
But how? — Izzy Moonbow
With magic! Quick! I need your crystals! There's a third crystal! Follow me! — Sunny Starscout
What? — Hitch Trailblazer
I've gotta rein that thing in! — Hitch Trailblazer
I've got your back, Hitch! — Zipp Storm
Hup! — Zipp Storm
Sprout! Stop! — Hitch Trailblazer
Where are the other crystals? — Sunny Starscout
This... ends... now! — Hitch Trailblazer
Whoa, whoa, whoa! — Hitch Trailblazer
Aah! Sunny! — Pipp Petals
Got it! We need the Unicorn Crystal! — Sunny Starscout
I'm looking, I'm looking! — Izzy Moonbow
Whoa! — Hitch Trailblazer
Hitch! — Zipp Storm
Whew... — Hitch Trailblazer
Found it! — Izzy Moonbow
Aah! No, no, no, no! — Izzy Moonbow
Whew... I'm okay! — Pipp Petals
Izzy! — Sunny Starscout
Aah! — Izzy Moonbow
We need to shut these down! — Zipp Storm
Alphabittle, look out! — Pipp Petals
Aah! — Izzy Moonbow
Okay, that was a bad idea! — Hitch Trailblazer
I've almost got it! Whoa! Oof! — Izzy Moonbow
No, no, no! — Hitch Trailblazer
It... It didn't work. — Izzy Moonbow
No, no, no! — Sunny Starscout
Oh, Sunny... — Izzy Moonbow
I understand now. It's not the crystals that need to be brought together. It's us. We can bring back everything that was lost, but it's up to us. We can stay separated by fear and distrust, or we can choose friendship. We can choose love. That's the true magic. — Sunny Starscout
What? Aah! — Sunny Starscout
Whoaaa! — Pipp Petals
We're actually flying! — Pipp Petals
Whoo! — Zipp Storm
Whoa, Sunny! Check you out! — Zipp Storm
Whoo! — Sunny Starscout
What?! — Hitch Trailblazer
I can't believe it! — Sunny Starscout
Now that's what I call a glow-up! — Izzy Moonbow
Look! — Pipp Petals
Wow! — Hitch Trailblazer
Stunning! — Pipp Petals
You did it, Sunny. — Hitch Trailblazer
No. We did it. Together. — Sunny Starscout
Now we never have to be apart! — Izzy Moonbow'Scuse me! Dragon on the move! Important princess documents comin' through! — Spike
Ommmmm... Ohhhhhhh mmmmy goodness, I can't handle this! Ooh! Nothing is working! I just have to get it together! Just go in there! And ask! This is your Friendship Festival! Everypony's happiness rests in your hooves. Ohhhh! — Twilight Sparkle
Okay, Twilight. Got all your charts and graphs. — Spike
Oh, thank goodness you're here, Spike! I'm just so nervous about this meeting! — Twilight Sparkle
Whachoo talkin' 'bout? — Spike
I'm about to ask the three most royal princesses of Equestria for a huge favor! What if they reject me? — Twilight Sparkle
It'll be fine. Just remember the most important thing. — Spike
Smile?! — Twilight Sparkle
Eh... no. You're a Princess, too. — Spike
Right! Good morning, Princesses. Thank you all for seeing me. I have an idea that I think will make our Friendship Festival the most wonderful celebration Equestria has ever seen! — Twilight Sparkle
Yes, Twilight! We are very excited! — Princess Celestia
Ponies have been arriving from all over all morning. — Princess Cadance
I'd like to think it's to see us, but Songbird Serenade might be the bigger attraction. — Princess Luna
Yes, she is the... "mane" event! And to make it extra special, I could use your help. Spike? — Twilight Sparkle
Songbird Serenade's performance is not scheduled to start until after you begin the sunset. And based on my precise calculation, to get the very best lighting for the stage, Princess Celestia, I was hoping you could make sure the sun stays about 28.1º to the south, and, Princess Luna, if you could raise the moon 62º to the north at the same time, it would reflect the sunlight on the other side and really frame the entire stage perfectly! — Twilight Sparkle
I... — Princess Luna
But wait! There's more! Cadance, if you could use your crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage, the sun and the moon will shine through it and create a truly amazing light show! — Twilight Sparkle
Presenting Songbird Serenade! — Spike
Ta-da... — Spike
So you're saying you want us to move the sun and the moon for the party. — Princess Luna
Well, I'd do it myself, except I don't have your magic. — Twilight Sparkle
Twilight, each of us uses our powers to serve Equestria in our own way. You are the Princess of Friendship. You already have all the magic you need. — Princess Celestia
So... that'd be a no? — Twilight Sparkle
Yes! — Rainbow Dash
Sky's cleared and ready for the festival! — Rainbow Dash
Whoa! — Pinkie Pie
Whoa! Heads up, Fluttershy! Out of control balloooooon!! — Pinkie Pie
Hoo. I don't think it's the balloon that's out of control, Pinkie Pie! — Fluttershy
Hey, y'all! — Applejack
Anypony up for some free samples of my family's apple cider? — Applejack
Ah! Thank you! Loved it! — Rainbow Dash
Wow, Rarity. It's a fine job you're doin' there. 'Course it might not get done 'til after the concert. — Applejack
Applejack, darling, anypony can do "fine". Twilight asked me, so clearly, she's going for fabulous, and fabulous takes time. — Rarity
Fabulous takes forever! But "awesome"... — Rainbow Dash
Whoa! — Fluttershy
...can get done in four seconds flat! Faster if I do my sonic rainboom! — Rainbow Dash
Aah! Nono, oh no! Don't you dare, Rainbow Dash! It looks wretched enough already. — Rarity
Oh come on, it's fine! — Rainbow Dash
If you were raised in a barn! Ahem, no offense, Applejack. — Rarity
None taken. Especially since I wasn't raised in a barn. My family just happens to have a barn. Where I was born. And... spent most of my formative years... — Applejack
Raised in a barn! — Rainbow Dash
Okay, just two hundred and eighteen things left to do and we're ready. — Twilight Sparkle
Hello, Spike. — Rarity
Uh, hi, Rarity. Heh heh. — Spike
How'd it go with the other Princesses? They like your idea? — Applejack
I bet they loved it! — Pinkie Pie
Not exactly. They think I can make today perfect without their magic. — Twilight Sparkle
And they are absolutely right, darling. This festival is your brilliant idea and we know you're up to the task! — Rarity
But what if I'm not?! What if Songbird Serenade hates the stage?! Or nopony makes a new friend?! And if I fail at the festival, then who am I?! — Twilight Sparkle
Twilight, look at me! This will be the biggest celebration Equestria has ever seen! As the Princess of Friendship, you cannot fail! This day will define who you are! The pressure is intense! It's almost too much for any single pony to handle! — Pinkie Pie
But you have us! So stop worrying. — Pinkie Pie
Ah! — Twilight Sparkle
Pinkie! — Twilight Sparkle
Oopsie! Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon needs a little bit more fine tuning! — Pinkie Pie
Hmmm... — Twilight Sparkle
Ms. Songbird Serenade? Um, I was just going to check on you. I'm Princess Twilight, and sorry about the mess. I'm usually not so... — Twilight Sparkle
Heh heh. — Twilight Sparkle
Storm clouds? I ordered perfect weather! Rainbow Dash?! — Twilight Sparkle
Uh... I... don't think those are storm clouds. — Rainbow Dash
Ooh! I bet those are the clowns I ordered! — Pinkie Pie
...Or definitely not the clowns I ordered. — Pinkie Pie
Is that a... unicorn? — Twilight Sparkle
I think so, but what happened to her horn? — Spike
"Tempest" is it? How may we help you? — Princess Celestia
Hi there. Princess of Friendship. Not exactly sure what's going on, but I know we can talk things out. — Twilight Sparkle
And why should we cower before you? There's one of you and hundreds of us. — Princess Luna
Cadance! — Princess Celestia
I can't... stop it! — Princess Cadance
Luna, quick! Go south beyond the Badlands! — Princess Celestia
Hmph! — Princess Luna
Seek help from the Queen of the Hippo— — Princess Celestia
Luna! — Twilight Sparkle
Twilight! — Rainbow Dash
Over here, y'all! — Applejack
Come on! — Twilight Sparkle
Everypony okay? — Applejack
I think my bottom's on backward. — Rarity
We just got our cupcakes handed to us by the worst party crasher ever! — Pinkie Pie
We gotta go back there and fight! — Rainbow Dash
Well, you saw the size of those goons. You seriously wanna go back? — Spike
So now what? We can't hide here forever. And let's be honest, we can't go back. Look at what they did to the Princesses. We gotta keep them from Twilight. — Applejack
The Queen. — Twilight Sparkle
Yeah, the Queen! Uh, what queen? — Pinkie Pie
Celestia told Luna to find the Queen of the... "Hippos". Luna can't, so I have to. — Twilight Sparkle
Uh, hippos? Seriously? — Rainbow Dash
I've heard they're surprisingly graceful for their size. Huh, but they're always hungry. — Pinkie Pie
Hungry? — Spike
Hippos? — Applejack
They're somewhere south, past the Badlands. — Twilight Sparkle
That means we'll have to... leave Equestria. Oh! — Fluttershy
I'm not even packed! — Rarity
I understand you're scared, and nopony else has to go. But I have to find this queen. She might be our only hope. — Twilight Sparkle
Well, you're not getting all the glory. We're in this together. — Rainbow Dash
We got your back. — Applejack
Indeedy! — Pinkie Pie
I am ready to save Equestria! — Rarity
Yay. — Fluttershy
We're all behind you, Twilight. — Spike
Let's go find this hippo! — Pinkie Pie
Uh, south? — Spike
Hehe! Whee! Whee! Boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy! Anypony up for a game of "I Spy"? — Pinkie Pie
No, really! Come on! I spy with my little eye something that is orange. No takers? It's you, Applejack! — Pinkie Pie
There's sand in my... everything... Heh... Saving... Equestria... Oh! Look! Maybe this guy knows which way to go! What's that, friend? We're lost? — Pinkie Pie
We could be going in... circles! Endless... sand... Nothin' for miles... but sand... and this rock... and this cactus... and this roooooooooaaaaaad.... ...this rooooooad.... — Spike
Hmm? A road? Where there's a road, there's a... — Twilight Sparkle
Whoa! — Spike
Cool! — Rainbow Dash
What is that? — Applejack
Oooh! A city! We are doing it, you guys! — Pinkie Pie
You know what they say: where there's a city, there's a spa! — Rarity
Who says that? — Rainbow Dash
'Case you forgot, we're on a mission to save Equestria. — Applejack
I can multitask. — Rarity
Oh... — Fluttershy
Ooh! — Fluttershy
Hi there! Ooh, I'm sorry. Here. Lemme help you with that. — Twilight Sparkle
Okay. We just gotta stick together. Be careful who you talk to. And try to blend in. — Twilight Sparkle
Can I have your attention please?! — Pinkie Pie
Can anypony take us to the Queen of the Hippos?! — Pinkie Pie
Well, how about a big warm hug from a grateful pony friend? — Pinkie Pie
How about this comb that I've never used? A picture of my sister Maud? This breath mint? Seriously, buddy. Help me help you. — Pinkie Pie
Pinkie, you can't just take off! And you don't need to announce to every... — Twilight Sparkle
Relax, Twilight! I totally got this! — Pinkie Pie
Who you callin' a gecko? — Spike
Uh, Spike isn't for sale. — Twilight Sparkle
Two storm bucks?! It's worth more than that! — Rarity
Heh? — Twilight Sparkle
Now, you listen here, fella, there ain't— — Applejack
You are awesome! — Rainbow Dash
And quite charming. — Rarity
Huh! — Spike
I don't know if we should trust him. — Twilight Sparkle
We could definitely use a friend out here! — Pinkie Pie
Ooh! A sort of a roco-hobo-Bohemian hodgepodge. — Rarity
Ooh! So many fun breakables! — Pinkie Pie
Whoa! — Rainbow Dash
Yessirree! The Queen of the Hippos! — Pinkie Pie
Oh, my! — Fluttershy
Huh? — Twilight Sparkle
I'll show ya! — Rainbow Dash
Here you go. I do apologize. If we were back home, I could've done something truly fabulous. — Rarity
Nothing. After all that you've done for us, consider it a "thank you". — Rarity
Guys! We've been looking for the wrong queen! We don't need the Queen of the Hippos! We need the Queen of the Hippogriffs! Part pony, part eagle! — Twilight Sparkle
Says here they're on the top of Mount Aris! — Twilight Sparkle
You mean the mountain right outside the window? — Pinkie Pie
Let's go, everypony. — Twilight Sparkle
I think we can get there on our own. — Twilight Sparkle
You were... You were going to sell us? — Rarity
I knew it! We gotta get outta here! — Twilight Sparkle
Tempest! — Twilight Sparkle
Go! Go! — Twilight Sparkle
I'm... gonna... be... sick! — Applejack
We have to get there! To the docks! Hurry! — Twilight Sparkle
That's it. — Applejack
Don't look down now! — Applejack
Yay! — Pinkie Pie
Dah! — Spike
Woo! — Pinkie Pie
Pinkie! — Twilight Sparkle
Best... escape... plan... ever! — Pinkie Pie
WHAT?! Thwa! — Twilight Sparkle
Shh! — Spike
Rats? — Rarity
Blugh! — Rainbow Dash
Whadaya think, Twilight? Should we just... ask 'em to take us? — Applejack
Last time we trusted somepony, he tried to sell us! — Twilight Sparkle
What? — Twilight Sparkle
Whoa, whoa, whoa! So you were about to toss us overboard and you stopped for a lunch break? — Rainbow Dash
So you're delivery guys? — Spike
Then can you deliver us to Mount Aris? — Twilight Sparkle
Right. Still going overboard. — Twilight Sparkle
There's pudding? — Rarity
Oh. — Rarity
You weren't always delivery birds, were you? What about before the Storm King? — Rainbow Dash
Ooh! I met that guy in the desert! — Pinkie Pie
Whoa! You used to be pirates?! — Rainbow Dash
So... pirates. — Rainbow Dash
You birds have a choice to make. You could let some cloven-hoofed Storm King tell you how to live your lives, or... — Rainbow Dash
...you could be awesome again! — Rainbow Dash
Rainbow Dash, this really isn't a good time for a— — Twilight Sparkle
—song. — Twilight Sparkle
Awesome! I knew you had it in ya! And now for the finishing touch! — Rainbow Dash
Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom! — Pinkie Pie
No no no no no! No! — Twilight Sparkle
Aw, yeah! — Rainbow Dash
Ohhh! — Twilight Sparkle
Nice! — Rainbow Dash
Tempest! — Twilight Sparkle
Oh my goodness! — Fluttershy
Ya think she saw my sonic rainboom? — Rainbow Dash
Are you kidding me?! — Twilight Sparkle
Whoa! — Spike
We have to get off this ship before they tell Tempest we're here! — Twilight Sparkle
We helped them get their mojo back! They're not gonna give us up! — Rainbow Dash
Whoa! — Pinkie Pie
I've got this! — Twilight Sparkle
Hold this! — Twilight Sparkle
What are you doing?! — Rainbow Dash
Oh, for Celestia's sake!!! — Rarity
Whee! — Pinkie Pie
I can't look! — Fluttershy
Ooh! Huh? — Rarity
Ooh! — Fluttershy
Whee! — Pinkie Pie
Huh? — Rainbow Dash
What in the hay is she up to? — Applejack
Huh? — Spike
Whee-hee-hee! — Pinkie Pie
Thank goodness. — Rarity
Phee-yew! Quick thinkin', Twilight! — Applejack
Yahoo! Ha ha! — Twilight Sparkle
That was fun! Can we do it again? — Pinkie Pie
Next stop, Mount Aris! — Rainbow Dash
We're home free! — Twilight Sparkle
We had to crash the balloon at the bottom of the mountain! That's it! I simply... cannot... even! I have nothing! The bad guys have won! I'm so sorryyyyyyyy-y-y-y! — Rarity
We're almost there! — Rainbow Dash
Will you stop saying that?! — Rarity
No, really! We're actually here! — Rainbow Dash
This is it! — Twilight Sparkle
Ooh! — Pinkie Pie
Well, I'll be. Hippogriffs, here we come! — Applejack
Time to rest my hooves! — Rarity
Are we sure this is the right place? — Rarity
Hello?! Is anypony home?! — Applejack
No Hippogriffies here! Or here! Or here! Or here or here or here! Waaaaaiiit! Nope! This place is emp-ty! — Pinkie Pie
But... Celestia... The map. They have to be here. — Twilight Sparkle
Something bad happened here. Something that turned this whole place into a ghost town. — Spike
A g-g-g-g-ghost town?! — Fluttershy
It's coming from over there! — Twilight Sparkle
Hey! Wait up! Cannonball! — Pinkie Pie
Pinkie! — Twilight Sparkle
She's gone! — Pinkie Pie
Now what? — Twilight Sparkle
Huh? — Pinkie Pie
Oh, boy. I hate epic adventures. — Rarity
Way to leave it to the last minute, Twilight! — Pinkie Pie
I didn't make these bubbles! — Twilight Sparkle
Then who did? — Fluttershy
Hello? We're looking for the Hippogriffs. — Twilight Sparkle
Please. The Storm King invaded our land. And we need their help. — Twilight Sparkle
Does your mother know where they are? — Twilight Sparkle
Hoo-hoo! — Twilight Sparkle
We need to find the Hippogriffs. Do you know what happened to them? — Twilight Sparkle
Hold on now. Lemme get this straight. When the Storm King came, you just abandoned your entire city and fled? — Applejack
But... how? — Twilight Sparkle
Oh! — Twilight Sparkle
Ooh! Oh! — Fluttershy
Oh. Wa-wa-whoa! — Applejack
Wow! — Fluttershy
These fins are divine! — Rarity
Hey, Applejack, I'll race ya to that coral! — Rainbow Dash
You're on! — Applejack
Woo-hoo! Ooh! Try it, Fluttershy! — Pinkie Pie
Yay. — Fluttershy
Guys? Guys? What is... ...happening?! — Spike
Aw, so cute! — Fluttershy
This is amazing! With this, we could transform everypony at home into something powerful enough to face the Storm King's army! — Twilight Sparkle
But... — Twilight Sparkle
But we've come all this way. And you can't just hide down here! Trapped forever! There's so much you're missing! — Twilight Sparkle
So that's it? We left home for nothin'? — Applejack
Ooh, ooh... — Rarity
That sounds lovely, darling, but you must realize, we can't stay. — Rarity
We've gotta get back to our families. — Applejack
I know we have to go, but you guys saw how disappointed Princess Skystar was. Couldn't we stay for just a little longer? — Pinkie Pie
Pinkie, we just don't have time for— — Applejack
Oh, no. No no. Pinkie's right. — Twilight Sparkle
Say what now? — Rainbow Dash
Well, we still need to come up with a plan to get back. A few minutes won't make a huge difference. And if there's anypony who can cram a lifetime of fun into a blink of an eye, it's Pinkie Pie! — Twilight Sparkle
So, go ahead and show Skystar the best time ever! — Twilight Sparkle
I won't let you down! — Pinkie Pie
I'm counting on it. — Twilight Sparkle
Ahhh! — Pinkie Pie
Ow! — Twilight Sparkle
No! Please! — Twilight Sparkle
What were you thinkin'? I mean, stealin' their pearl? — Applejack
It was the only way to save Equestria. — Twilight Sparkle
'Cept it wasn't! The Queen was going to say yes! We did what you told us and that's what made her realize we were ponies worth saving! Unless... You didn't really want us to show her the best time ever! You just wanted us to distract her! — Pinkie Pie
I never would have done it, but this isn't Equestria! We can't just dance around with con artists, make rainbooms in the sky and expect everything to work out! It's not enough! We are not enough! — Twilight Sparkle
No, Twilight! We stuck together! We were gonna get the help we needed! The only thing that stopped us... was you! — Pinkie Pie
Well, I'm doing the best I can! It's all on me. I'm the one Tempest wants. I'm the last Princess! — Twilight Sparkle
You're also the only one who doesn't trust her friends! — Pinkie Pie
Well, maybe, I would've been better off without friends like YOU! — Twilight Sparkle
Pinkie, I- — Twilight Sparkle
I just can't talk to you right now. — Pinkie Pie
Twilight? It's okay. You'll figure it out. — Spike
No! I can't. I ruined everything! There's no chance to save Equestria now. It's all my fault! Spike? — Twilight Sparkle
Twilight, look out! — Spike
No, no, no, no, no! Noooooo! — Twilight Sparkle
Twilight, help me! — Spike
Spiiiiiike!!! — Twilight Sparkle
Twiliiiiiight!!! — Spike
Why are you doing this? You're a pony! Just like me. — Twilight Sparkle
I'm so sorry you felt so alone. — Twilight Sparkle
Friendship didn't fail me. I failed friendship. — Twilight Sparkle
This whole journey was such a mistake. All we wanted was somepony to help us. — Fluttershy
Ya think, maybe it's time we talk to Twilight? — Applejack
She's! Been! Taken!!! — Spike
What?! — Rainbow Dash
Twilight's been taken! Tempest! She grabbed her! And took her on her ship! — Spike
We gotta get her back! — Rainbow Dash
How? We'll never catch up! — Fluttershy
And we got no way to defeat those monsters. — Applejack
Well! Look what the cat dragged in! Himself! — Rarity
Now don't get too excited. He's just talkin' about us. — Applejack
Yeah. That was pretty great. — Rainbow Dash
Whoa! — Spike
Ahhhh! — Pinkie Pie
That's it, right? We didn't make friends with anypony else? — Spike
We're coming, Twilight! — Pinkie Pie
As soon as we bake up a plan! — Pinkie Pie
Tempest, don't do this. Don't give the Storm King— — Twilight Sparkle
I'm the Princess of Friendship! — Twilight Sparkle
No! — Twilight Sparkle
Pinkie, quit lookin' so happy! Ya ain't foolin' nopony! — Applejack
Oh! Okay! — Pinkie Pie
The jig is up! — Rainbow Dash
Lovely! — Rarity
Surprise! — Pinkie Pie
