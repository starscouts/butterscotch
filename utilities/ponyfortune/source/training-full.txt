:'''Spike''': 'Scuse me! Dragon on the move! Important princess documents comin' through!
:'''S04E26 Unnamed Earth Mare #1''': Whoa! Everypony from Manehattan to Saddle Arabia is here!
:'''Apple Cobbler''': I know, filly! We almost couldn't book a stable!
:'''Clear Skies''': Princess Twilight must have her hooves full with this giant Festival!
:'''Female Pony 2''': Are you kidding?! She's smart and organized and cool under pressure! There's nothing she can't handle!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ommmmm... Ohhhhhhh mmmmy goodness, I can't handle this! Ooh! Nothing is working! I just have to get it together! Just go in there! And ask! This is your Friendship Festival! Everypony's happiness rests in your hooves. [facehoofs] Ohhhh!
:'''Spike''': Okay, Twilight. Got all your charts and graphs.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, thank goodness you're here, Spike! I'm just so nervous about this meeting!
:'''Spike''': Whachoo talkin' 'bout?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] I'm about to ask the three most royal princesses of Equestria for a huge favor! What if they reject me?
:'''Spike''': It'll be fine. Just remember the most important thing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Smile?!
:'''Spike''': Eh... no. You're a Princess, too.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right! [exhales] Good morning, Princesses. Thank you all for seeing me. I have an idea that I think will make our Friendship Festival the most wonderful celebration Equestria has ever seen!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Yes, Twilight! We are very excited!
:'''Princess Cadance''': Ponies have been arriving from all over all morning.
:'''Princess Luna''': I'd like to think it's to see us, but Songbird Serenade might be the bigger attraction.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, she ''is'' the... "mane" event! [giggles] And to make it ''extra'' special, I could use your help. Spike?
:[whiteboard wheeling in]
:'''Spike''': [humming fanfare]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Songbird Serenade's performance is not scheduled to start until after you begin the sunset. And based on my precise calculation, to get the very best lighting for the stage, Princess Celestia, I was hoping you could make sure the sun stays about 28.1º to the south, and, Princess Luna, if you could raise the moon 62º to the north at the same time, it would reflect the sunlight on the other side and really frame the entire stage perfectly!
:'''Princess Luna''': I...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But wait! There's more! Cadance, if you could use your crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage, the sun ''and'' the moon will shine through it and create a truly amazing light show!
:'''Spike''': Presenting Songbird Serenade!
::Yeah, yeah, yeah!
::Whoa-ho!
:Whoa!
:[bonk!]
:'''Spike''': [weakly] Ta-da...
:'''Princess Luna''': So you're saying you want us to move the sun and the moon for the party.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'd do it myself, except I don't have your magic. [snorts]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight, each of us uses our powers to serve Equestria in our ''own'' way. You are the Princess of Friendship. You already have all the magic you need.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So... that'd be a no?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yes!
:[zooming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sky's cleared and ready for the festival!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [blowing up a balloon]
:[balloon squeaking]
:[balloon deflating]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa!
:[birds whistling in harmony]
:[balloon zooming by]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa! Heads up, Fluttershy! Out of control balloooooon!!
:'''Fluttershy''': Hoo. I don't think it's the balloon that's out of control, Pinkie Pie!
:'''Applejack''': Hey, y'all!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]
:'''Applejack''': Anypony up for some free samples of my family's apple cider?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ah! Thank you! Loved it!
:'''Rarity''': [humming]
:'''Applejack''': Wow, Rarity. It's a fine job you're doin' there. 'Course it might not get done 'til ''after'' the concert.
:'''Rarity''': Applejack, darling, anypony can do "fine". Twilight asked me, so clearly, she's going for fabulous, and fabulous takes time.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fabulous takes forever! But "awesome"...
:[flies past]
:'''Fluttershy''': Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...can get done in four seconds flat! ''Faster'' if I do my sonic rainboom!
:'''Rarity''': Aah! Nono, oh no! Don't you dare, Rainbow Dash! It looks wretched enough already.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh come on, it's fine!
:'''Rarity''': If you were raised in a barn! Ahem, no offense, Applejack.
:'''Applejack''': None taken. Especially since I wasn't raised in a barn. My family just happens to have a barn. Where I was born. And... spent most of my formative years...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [very quickly] Raised in a barn!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, just two hundred and eighteen things left to do and we're ready.
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', '''Fluttershy''' and '''Pinkie Pie''': Hey, Twilight!
:'''Rarity''': Hello, Spike.
:'''Spike''': Uh, hi, Rarity. Heh heh.
:'''Applejack''': How'd it go with the other Princesses? They like your idea?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I bet they loved it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Not exactly. They think I can make today perfect without their magic.
:'''Rarity''': And they are absolutely right, darling. This festival is ''your'' brilliant idea and we know you're up to the task!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But what if I'm not?! What if Songbird Serenade hates the stage?! Or nopony makes a new friend?! And if I fail at the festival, then who am I?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight, look at me! This will be the biggest celebration Equestria has ever seen! As the Princess of Friendship, you cannot fail! This day will define who you are! The pressure is intense! ''It's almost too much for any single pony to handle!'' [screams]
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But you have us! So stop worrying.
:[clink!]
:[magic whirs off]
:[balloon pops]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [burps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah!
{{#lst:We Got This Together|song}}

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oopsie! Guess my easy bake confetti cake cannon needs a little bit more fine tuning!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nickers] Hmmm...
:'''Code Red''': Songbird Serenade? Is it really her? It is, it is!
:'''Songbird Serenade''': Hiya. I'm lookin' for the pony in charge?
:[camera flashing]
:'''Songbird Serenade''': I need to set up for my sound check.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ms. Songbird Serenade? Um, I was just going to check on you. [laughs nervously] I'm Princess Twilight, and sorry about the mess. I'm usually not so...
:[ponies gasping]
:'''Female pony''': Oh! How embarrassing!
:'''Songbird Serenade''': Caked in cake?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Heh heh.
:'''Vinny''': You have visual on buttercream?
:'''Whinnyfield''': Visual confirmed. Go for cleanup.
:[thunder]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Storm clouds? I ordered perfect weather! Rainbow Dash?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... I... don't think those are storm clouds.
:[ominous music]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! I bet those are the clowns I ordered!
:[crumbling]

:'''Party Favor''': Brian, no!

:[microphone feedback]
:'''Grubber''': [clears throat, voice echoing] Ponieth of Equethtria, we come on behalf of the fearsome, the powerful, the almighty...''Thtorm King!''
:[ponies cowering and whispering]
:'''Female pony''': This is terrible!
:'''Grubber''': And now, to deliver the evil, evil methage, put your hooveth together for Commander Tempeeeetht!
:[sparking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is that a... unicorn?
:'''Spike''': I think so, but what happened to her horn?
:'''Princess Celestia''': "Tempest" is it? How may we help you?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Oh, I'm so glad you asked. How about we start with your complete and total surrender?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hi there. Princess of Friendship. Not exactly sure what's going on, but I know we can talk things out.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Oh, goody. All four Princesses. Here's the deal, ladies. I need your magic. Give it up nicely, please, or we make it difficult for everyone!
:'''Princess Luna''': And why should we cower before you? There's one of you and hundreds of us.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [chuckles] I was hoping you'd choose "difficult".

:[water flowing]
:'''Rarity''': [catching her breath]
:'''Applejack''': Everypony okay?
:'''Rarity''': I think my bottom's on backward.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We just got our cupcakes handed to us by the worst party crasher ever!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We gotta go back there and fight!
:'''Spike''': Well, you saw the size of those goons. You seriously wanna go back?
:'''Applejack''': So now what? We can't hide here forever. And let's be honest, we ''can't'' go back. Look at what they did to the Princesses. We gotta keep them from Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Queen.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, the Queen! Uh, what queen?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Celestia told Luna to find the Queen of the... "Hippos". Luna can't, so I have to.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, hippos? Seriously?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I've heard they're surprisingly graceful for their size. Huh, but they're always hungry.
:'''Spike''': Hungry?
:'''Applejack''': Hippos?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They're somewhere south, past the Badlands.
:'''Fluttershy''': That means we'll have to... leave Equestria. Oh!
:'''Rarity''': I'm not even packed!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I understand you're scared, and nopony else has to go. But I have to find this queen. She might be our only hope.
:[music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, you're not getting ''all'' the glory. We're in this together.
:'''Applejack''': We got your back.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Indeedy!
:'''Rarity''': I am ready to save Equestria!
:'''Fluttershy''': Yay.
:'''Spike''': We're all behind you, Twilight.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's go find this hippo!
:'''Spike''': Uh, south?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hehe! Whee! [giggles] Whee! Boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy-boingy! Anypony up for a game of "I Spy"?
:'''All but Pinkie Pie''': [groan]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, really! Come on! I spy with my little eye something that is orange. No takers? It's you, Applejack! [giggles]

:[storm creatures grunting]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': All this power wasted on parties when there are far greater uses.
:[ringtone]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Well? Answer it!
:[dial-up modem noises]
:'''The Storm King''': Where am I supposed to be looking? I never understand how this spell works. Tempest!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Over here, Your Excellency.
:'''The Storm King''': Where?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Over here.
:'''The Storm King''': Huh?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': No. No, right. Look right.
:'''The Storm King''': My right?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Yep.
:'''The Storm King''': Oh. There you are. Here's the deal. I'm in the middle of a big re-brand here. "The Storm King" is tracking well as "intensely intimidating", but you know what? I need to back it up. You know what I need to back it up with? ''A storm!'' That would be great! You promised me magic that could control the elements, and right now, I'm holding a what? A branch. A twig. Bleh!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Uh, that would be the Staff of Sacanas, Your Excellency, and it will...
:'''The Storm King''': Mm-hmm?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': ...channel the magic of the four rulers of this land.
:'''The Storm King''': Mm-hmmmm?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': You'll soon have the power of a hundred armies.
:'''The Storm King''': So that would be a yes on your locking down the four Pegacornicuseses, or whatever you call them?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Give me three days. I'll have everything ready for your arrival.
:'''The Storm King''': [ominous] Remember, Tempest. Only I have the power to make you whole. Make this twig work, and you'll get your reward. Fail me, and your horn won't be the only thing that's broken.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': It won't be a problem.
:'''The Storm King''': [upbeat] Great! [warbling] I'm ready to power up, crash and bash, and be the biggest, baddest bugaloooooo...
:[beat]
:'''Grubber''': Thorry, bad thpell thervice. You want me to call him back?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Do you have the Princess?
:'''Grubber''': Well, uh, funny thtory. It kinda theemth like she... she might've like, you know, got away... a little bit. I know you're dithappointed, but I got one word for you: "thpongecake".
:[zap]
:'''Grubber''': [screams]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': I need all four for the staff to work.
:'''Grubber''': Hey, I know! I want the Thtorm King to fix that crazy horn as badly as ''you'' do. It lookth like a crackly chipped tooth on the top of your head. And you know you don't look good in hatth.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': That Princess is not gonna keep me from getting my horn back! Prepare my ship!
:'''Grubber''': Ihhh!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Please. How far could one little pony get on her own?

:[slide guitar sting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting] There's sand in my... everything... Heh... Saving... Equestria... [demented laugh] Oh! Look! Maybe this guy knows which way to go! What's that, friend?  We're lost? [demented laugh, coughs, faints]
:'''Rarity''', '''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Spike''': [panting]
:'''Spike''': We could be going in... circles! Endless... sand... [inhales] Nothin' for miles... but sand... [breathes] and this rock... [coughs] and this cactus... [breathes] and this roooooooooaaaaaad.... [breathes, faints, breathes] ...this rooooooad....

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Can anypony take us to the Queen of the Hippos?!
:'''Mori''': You want something? You gotta give something!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, how about a big warm hug from a grateful pony friend?
:[honk]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How about this comb that I've never used? A picture of my sister Maud? This breath mint? Seriously, buddy. Help me help you.

:'''Louise''': How much for the giant gecko?
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Spike''': Who you callin' a gecko?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Spike isn't for sale.
:'''Vera''': I want that fancy purple hair! I'll give ya two storm bucks for it!
:'''Rarity''': Two storm bucks?! It's worth more than that!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Heh?

:'''Applejack''': Now, you listen here, fella, there ain't—
:'''Capper''': Don't worry, don't worry, as long as you're not covered in purple splotches, you'll be fine. Uh-oh.
:'''Mori''': [gasps] What do I do?!
:'''Capper''': Enjoy your last moments and don't touch anyone. Because parts ''will'' fall off.
:'''Mori''': [screams] Me parts!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': You are awesome!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know if we should trust him.

:'''Capper''': Naw-naw-naw, I don't need you sonic "rainbooming" up in my place, thank you very much. Whoa, hey, hold up now. Whoa.
:'''Rarity''': Here you go. I do apologize. If we were back home, I could've done something truly fabulous.
:'''Capper''': Okay... What's the catch?
:'''Rarity''': Nothing. After all that you've done for us, consider it a "thank you".
:'''Capper''': Oh. Uh, don't thank me. Really.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Guys! We've been looking for the wrong queen! We don't need the Queen of the Hippos! We need the Queen of the Hippo''griffs''! Part pony, part eagle!
:'''Capper''': Oh! Oh, the Hippo''griffs''! Now, the trouble with that is... no one knows... where they are...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Says here they're on the top of Mount Aris!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You mean the mountain right outside the window?
:'''Capper''': Objects in windows may be less mountainous than they appear. Heh heh heh...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's go, everypony.
:'''Capper''': [gasps] Wait! [cat yowl] You can't—you can't make it by y'allselves. You need an airship! And lucky for you, I can get you a ride.

:[union whistle blows]
:'''Captain Celaeno''': All right! That's lunch!
:[splut]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?
:[munching]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa, whoa, whoa! So you were about to toss us overboard and you stopped for a lunch break?
:'''Boyle''': Storm King only allows one break a day for meals, then it's back to hauling goods.
:'''Spike''': So you're delivery guys?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': And gals. These uniforms aren't exactly doing us any favors.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then can you deliver us to Mount Aris?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Sorry. We do what the Storm King orders or we suffer his wrath.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right. Still going overboard.
:'''Lix Spittle''': Eh, it's nothing personal. Pudding?
:'''Rarity''': There's pudding?
:[splut]
:'''Rarity''': Oh.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You weren't always delivery birds, were you? What about before the Storm King?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Yeah. We used to be much more adventurous.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! I met that guy in the desert!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa! You used to be ''pirates''?!
:'''Mullet''': Um, we prefer the term "swashbuckling treasure hunters".
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So... pirates.
:'''Squabble''': [squawks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You birds have a choice to make. You could let some cloven-hoofed Storm King tell you how to live your lives, or...
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...you could be awesome again!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow Dash, this really isn't a good time for a—

:'''Captain Celaeno''': Come on! Let's show these little ponies how it's done!
:'''Mane Six except Twilight''': [oohing and ahing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Awesome! I ''knew'' you had it in ya! And now for the finishing touch!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom! Rainboom!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No no no no no! No!
:[sonic rainboom]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aw, yeah! [laughs]
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Wow!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ohhh!

:'''Grubber''': [slurping] Huh? Huh? Looka that rainbow! Looka that rainbow! Whoa, that'th so cool!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Yeah. Of them to alert us. Funny, though. [to Capper] They don't seem to be heading to Black Skull Island.
:'''Capper''': Like "ha ha" funny or... ha ha...
:'''Grubber''': [yells]
:[airship backfiring]

:[swords clanging]
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Yeah! Ha ha!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nice!
:'''Captain Celaeno''': [laughs]
:'''Squabble''': [squawking]
:[bell ringing]
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Storm guards! Looks like they found you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Tempest!
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Secure the rigging! Lock down the cargo! Everyone, prepare to be boarded!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh my goodness!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ya think she saw my sonic rainboom?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you ''kidding me''?!

:[thud!]
:[pirates yelping]
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Grubber''': [grunts]
:[storm creatures grunt]
:'''Grubber''': [chomps]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Where is the Pony Princess?
:'''Captain Celaeno''': "Princess"? Prin-Cess, Prin-Cess... Nope. All we're hauling is Storm King merchandise.
:'''Squabble''': [squawks]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': You do realize that if you ''were'' to shelter fugitives, the Storm King would be quite... explosive.
:'''Captain Celaeno''': [gulps]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering loudly] We have to get off this ship before they tell Tempest we're here!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whispering loudly] We helped them get their mojo back! They're not gonna give us up!
:'''Rarity''': [breathes loudly]
:'''Fluttershy''': [shivers]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whoa!
:[crash!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:[woodwinds]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've got this!

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Now, I'm gonna count to three, and if you don't tell me where they are, your ship is going down. One...

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hold this!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What are you doing?!

:'''Tempest Shadow''': ...two...
:'''Grubber''': Oh, thith is inteeenth!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Three!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams, laughs] Whee!
:'''Fluttershy''': [yells] I can't look!
:'''Rarity''': [screams] Ooh! [resumes screaming] Huh?
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whee!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?

:'''Spike''': [yelps] Huh? [breathes fire]
:'''Mane Six''': [cheering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whee-hee-hee!
:'''Mane Six''': [sighing]
:'''Rarity''': Thank goodness.
:'''Applejack''': Phee-yew! Quick thinkin', Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yahoo! Ha ha!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That was fun! Can we do it again?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Next stop, Mount Aris!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're home free!
:'''Mane Six''': [cheering]

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Huh.
:'''Grubber''': Wow, this is a ''real'' artitht!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Looks like they're heading to Mount Aris.
:'''Capper''': Really? [stammering and laughing nervously] Mou- Mount Aris? I... Well, that's my mis— I didn't know that... Mount Ari... My bad, I didn't... That's my... I'm sorry, I'm very very sorry.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Now, about your betrayal...

:[waves crashing]
:'''Rarity''': We ''had'' to crash the balloon at the bottom of the mountain! That's it! I simply... cannot... even! I have nothing! The bad guys have won! I'm so sorryyyyyyyy-y-y-y!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We're almost there!
:'''Rarity''': [growls] Will you stop saying that?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No, really! We're actually here!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] This is it!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh!
:'''Applejack''': Well, I'll be. [laughs] Hippogriffs, here we come!
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Time to rest my hooves!
:[quiet strings and woodwinds]
:'''Rarity''': Are we sure this is the right place?
:'''Applejack''': Hello?! Is anypony home?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No Hippogriffies here! Or here! Or here! Or here or here or here! Waaaaaiiit! Nope! This place is emp-ty!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But... Celestia... The map. They have to be here.
:'''Spike''': Something bad happened here. Something that turned this whole place into a ghost town.
:'''Fluttershy''': A g-g-g-g-ghost town?!
:[distant humming]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] It's coming from over there!
:[humming continues to grow louder]
:[crumbles]
:'''Princess Skystar''': [gasps] What was that?!
:[splash!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey! Wait up! Cannonball!
:[splash!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sputters] She's gone!
:[water flushing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now what?
:[bubbles]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh?
:'''Mane Six''': [scream]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, boy. I hate epic adventures.
:'''Mane Six''': [screaming, trying to talk]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps for air]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasping for air]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Way to leave it to the last minute, Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I didn't ''make'' these bubbles!
:'''Fluttershy''': Then [pants] who did?
:[something swimming past]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hello? We're looking for the Hippogriffs.
:'''Princess Skystar''': How do I know I can trust you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Please. The Storm King invaded our land. And we need their help.
:'''Princess Skystar''': The Storm King?! I'm so glad I saved you guys! I'm totally taking you to my mom!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Does your mother know where they are?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oho! [singsongy] She might have an idea! [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hoo-hoo!
:[bubbles]

:'''Princess Skystar''': We're almost there!
:[choir and orchestra playing]
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': Wow!
:[choir and orchestra continue]
:'''Princess Skystar''': Mother, look what I found!
:'''Queen Novo''': Is it another shell?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Mm-mm.
:'''Queen Novo''': Because I am telling you if it is another shell, I am— [gasps loudly] Princess Skystar, whatta you done?! You know surface dwellers are forbidden here! Guards!
:[guards grunting]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Princess Skystar''': No no n-no! M-M-Mom, please! It is so not like that! The Storm King is trying to destroy ''their'' home, too!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We need to find the Hippogriffs. Do you know what happened to them?
:'''Queen Novo''': Well, of course I know. I'm the queen. I know ''everything''.
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oh, oh, it's such a good story!
:'''Queen Novo''': Don't you dare tell them!
:'''Princess Skystar''': Once upon a time, like, a while ago, the Hippogriffs ''did'' live on Mount Aris.
:'''Mane Six''': Oooh!
:'''Queen Novo''': Did I not say don't tell them? But hey, I'm just the queen. Don't mind me.
:'''Princess Skystar''': Fine! I can't tell you! But if I ''could'' tell you, I'd say that that horned beast did show up to steal their magic!
:'''Queen Novo''': Seriously?
:'''Princess Skystar''': But, to keep it out of his clutches, their brave and majestic leader, Queen Novo, hid them deep underwater where he could never go! We ''are''... Well, we ''were'' the Hippogriffs! Ta-da! [laughs] [whispering] But I totally did not tell you that!
:'''Queen Novo''': Well, I guess the pearl is out the oyster now. ''I'' am Queen Novo.
:'''Applejack''': Hold on now. Lemme get this straight. When the Storm King came, you just abandoned your entire city and fled?
:'''Princess Skystar''': We didn't flee! We swam! Y'know, in order to flee.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But... how?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oh! Can we show them? Huh? These are the first guests we've had in, like, foreveeerrr! Can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we, can we?
:'''Queen Novo''': Well, I suppose I ''should'' make sure it still works. [chuckles]
:'''Princess Skystar''': [giggles]
:'''Queen Novo''': Careful, now.
:'''Princess Skystar''': [squeals]
:'''Mane Six''': Huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! [laughs]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh! Oh! [laughs]
:'''Applejack''': Oh. Wa-wa-whoa! [laughs]
:'''Mane Six''': [awed reactions]
:'''Fluttershy''': Wow!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs]
:'''Rarity''': These fins are divine!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, Applejack, I'll race ya to that coral!
:'''Applejack''': You're on!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Woo-hoo! [giggles] Ooh! Try it, Fluttershy!
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles] Yay.
:'''Spike''': Guys? Guys? What is... [puffs] ...happening?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Aw, so cute!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is amazing! With this, we could transform everypony at home into something powerful enough to face the Storm King's army!
:'''Queen Novo''': Or it could end up in his greedy claws!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But...
:'''Queen Novo''': Honey, I'm sorry about your home. I truly am. But my responsibility is to protect ''my'' subjects. The pearl... is not going anywhere.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But we've come all this way. And you can't just hide down here! Trapped forever! There's so much you're missing!
:'''Queen Novo''': We are one hundred percent okay with that!
:'''Jamal''': [chitters]
:'''Queen Novo''': Yes, Jamal?
:'''Jamal''': [chitters]
:'''Queen Novo''': Ooh! Time for my seaweed wrap.
:'''Jamal''': [chitters]
:'''Queen Novo''': Yes, a massage, too. Mama needs her deep tissue.
:'''Applejack''': So that's it? We left home for nothin'?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oh, my gosh! Best... idea! You can stay with us! Forever! [laughs] There are so many things we can do! We can make friendship bracelets out of shells and... picture frames outta shells and... decorative wastebaskets out of shells... Oh, I have so many projects that involve shells, haha! Now I have someone new to share them with! I mean, aside from my friends, Shelly and Sheldon. Right? "Shelly"?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:'''Princess Skystar''': And "Sheldon"? [chuckles] Get it? [chuckles, snorts]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, ooh...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Rarity''': That sounds lovely, darling, but you must realize, we can't stay.
:'''Applejack''': We've gotta get back to our families.
:'''Princess Skystar''': Oh, no. Of course. Of course. Heh. Of course you have your own friends back home. It's fine. It's fine. Heh. [whispering] Shelly and Sheldon get jealous anyways. Heh. It's probably for the best. [sighs] Yeah, I'll just, um... [sadly] I'll get Mom to, uh, turn you back so you can go home.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know we have to go, but you guys saw how disappointed Princess Skystar was. Couldn't we stay for just a little longer?
:'''Applejack''': Pinkie, we just don't have time for—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no. No no. Pinkie's right.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Say what now?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, we still need to come up with a plan to get back. A few minutes won't make a huge difference. And if there's anypony who can cram a lifetime of fun into a blink of an eye, it's Pinkie Pie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squee]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, go ahead and show Skystar the best time ever!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I won't let you down!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm counting on it.

:[alarm continues]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [struggling] Ow!
:'''Queen Novo''': [snarls]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! Please!
:'''Queen Novo''': All of this so you could sneak in and take the pearl?!
:'''Princess Skystar''': [yelps]
:'''Queen Novo''': [to Skystar] This is why we don't bring strangers into our home! [to Twilight, ominously] You don't deserve to be one of us.

:'''Mane Six''': [gasping for air]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughing]
:'''Rarity''': [gasping, faints]
:'''Applejack''': What were you thinkin'? I mean, stealin' their pearl?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] It was the only way to save Equestria.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': 'Cept it wasn't! The Queen was going to say yes! We did what you told us and that's what made her realize we were ponies worth saving! [gasps] Unless... You didn't really ''want'' us to show her the best time ever! You just wanted us to ''distract her''!
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Applejack''', '''Rarity''' and '''Fluttershy''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I never would have ''done'' it, but this isn't Equestria! We can't just dance around with con artists, make rainbooms in the sky and expect everything to work out! It's not enough! We are not enough!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No, Twilight! ''We'' stuck together! ''We'' were gonna get the help we needed! The only thing that stopped us... was ''you''!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'm ''doing the best I can!''  It's all on me. ''I'm'' the one Tempest wants. ''I'm'' the last Princess!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're ''also'' the only one who ''doesn't trust her friends''!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, maybe, I would've been better off without ''friends like YOU''!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[soft strings]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, I-
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sniffles] I just can't talk to you right now.

:[waves crashing]
:[piano]
:'''Spike''': Twilight? It's okay. You'll figure it out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [tearfully] No! [sobs] I ''can't''. I ruined everything! [sobs quietly] There's no chance to save Equestria now. [whimpers] It's all my fault! [weeps] Spike? [gasps]
:'''Spike''': [muffled] Twilight, look out!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [screams, gasps] No, no, no, no, no! Noooooo!

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Aww, the "Princess of Friendship". With no friends! [chuckles] And no way out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Why are you doing this? You're a pony! Just like me.
:[zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [yelps]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': I'm nothing like you! I'm more than you'll ever be!
{{#lst:Open Up Your Eyes|song}}
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm so sorry you felt so alone.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': I saw the truth. My "friends" abandoned me when times got tough. Looks like I'm not the only one. Face it, Princess. Friendship has failed you, too.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Friendship didn't fail me. I failed friendship.

:[silence]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] This whole journey was such a mistake. [gasps] All we wanted was somepony to help us.
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] Ya think, maybe it's time we talk to Twilight?
:'''Spike''': She's! Been! ''Taken!!!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?!
:'''Spike''': [panting] Twilight's been taken! Tempest! She grabbed her! And took her on her ship!
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We gotta get her back!
:'''Fluttershy''': How? We'll ''never'' catch up!
:'''Applejack''': And we got no way to defeat those monsters.
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs]
:'''Capper''': Well, good thing I happen to know of a group of mighty heroes that could handle this easily!
:'''Rarity''': [angrily] Well! Look what the cat dragged in! Himself!
:'''Capper''': These heroes have faced the Storm King's army and escaped! I've seen them tackle the streets of the roughest towns, break out of the tightest situations, and inspire others to join their cause!
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': Ooooh.
:'''Applejack''': Now don't get too excited. He's just talkin' about us.
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': Awww.
:'''Capper''': They even escaped certain doom at the hooves of Commander Tempest!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. That ''was'' pretty great.
:'''Captain Celaeno''': Are you kidding me?! That was ''awesome''!
:'''Squabble''': [squawks]
:'''Boyle''': Figured you could use a claw!
:'''Captain Celaeno''': We're on board to help you fight the Storm King! Just not on board our... actual ship.
:'''Mullet''': That crazy unicorn sunk it. But you got back our argh! And we're ready to kick some booty.
:'''Boyle''' and '''other pirates''': [laugh heartily]

:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Capper''': Is that what I think it is?
:'''Princess Skystar''': Hellooooooo!! Me again! [giggles] I'm gonna get so grounded, but I talked things over with Shelly and Sheldon and they pointed out that you were just trying to help your friends.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ahhhh!
:'''Princess Skystar''': So I wanna help too. 'Cause ya know... one small thing... [whispering] can make a really big difference!
:'''Spike''': That's it, right? We didn't make friends with anypony else?
:'''Capper''': All right, y'all! I think our course is clear. Y'all ready to do this thang?

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Your magic? Did you think you'd keep it all to yourself? Time to share. I'd love for everybody out there to know what I can really do.
:'''The Storm King''': Ooh, fascinating!  What ''can'' you really do?
:'''Grubber''': Your bidding, of courth, Your Mighty One.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm the Princess of Friendship!
:'''The Storm King''': [laughs] Oh. That's nice. [to Tempest] Why is this one still moving?
:'''Tempest Shadow''': She and her friends put up a bit of a fight, but she's alone now. She won't be a problem.
:'''The Storm King''': Yeah. So, speaking of problems, this place, it seems a little too—oh, I don't know—''cute!!!'' I don't like cute! I never did like cute! Doesn't really go with my whole "big bad powerful magic guy" thing, does it?! Deliver the punchline, Tempest, because this has gotta be a joke! [grunts]

:'''The Storm King''': Yeah, yeah! Friendship, and flowers, and ponies, and bleh! I'm so totally over the cute pony thing. This... ends... now!
:[rumbling]
:'''The Storm King''': [laughing]

:'''Capper''': Uh-oh.
:'''Rarity''' and '''Fluttershy''': [yelp]

:'''The Storm King''': [maniacal laughter] Yeah!

:'''Capper''': Move them hooves, ponies!
:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:[storm creatures yelling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You'd have to be flying faster than a speeding Pegasus to break through ''that'' wind!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Excellent idea, Rainbow Dash!

:'''The Storm King''': Now I truly am the Storm King! And the entire world will bow to my ba-ba-ba-boom, baby!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Yes, yes, you are every bit as powerful as I promised, Sire, now, restore my horn and I swear to use my magic to serve you!
:'''The Storm King''': [laughs] Who cares about your dinky little unicorn horn?!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': But... we... we had an agreement!
:'''The Storm King''': Get with the program! I ''used'' you! It's kind of what I do!
:[zaps]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [yelps]
:[zap!]
:'''The Storm King''': Ahh!

:'''The Storm King''': [grunts]

:'''The Storm King''': Ow!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [gasps, grunts]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hold on!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': Why are you saving me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Because this is what friends do.
:[strings and harp play "Open Up Your Eyes"]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts]
:'''The Storm King''': [sarcastically] Awwww! Isn't that just so sweet! [laughs] Yeah. See ya!

:'''Mullet''': You sure about this?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Just do it! Thank you! I'm excited! Who's excited?! Aaah! I've never been so excited!
:'''Squabble''': [squawks]
:[boom! boom! boom!]
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [screaming]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] Whee!

:'''The Storm King''': [laughs] Ooh!
:[window cracks]
:[squee]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [weakly] Bull's-eye!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie! You all came back! I'm so sorry! I was wrong to—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm sorry, too. Friends mess up sometimes, but we never should've—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, make up later! ''This isn't over!''
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:[crackling, crumbling]
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [panting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts, gasps] I've gotta get control of it!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Go! You've got this, Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. ''We've'' got this. Together.
:["Time to Be Awesome" action theme playing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whee!

:'''Spike''': Songbird Serenade!
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Songbird Serenade''': And now, to celebrate the fact that we're all still here in one piece, give it up for Princess Twilight and her friends!
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Code Red''': All right! Way to go, guys!

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Well, that's one thing that never changes around here. The party.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I hope you'll stay. More friends are definitely merrier.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [sighs] But, um... my horn.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You know, your horn is pretty powerful, just like the pony it belongs to.
:'''Tempest Shadow''': I ''did'' tell you I wanted to show everypony in Equestria what I could do, right?

:'''Tempest Shadow''': Actually, that's not my real name.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oooh! What is it?!
:'''Tempest Shadow''': [quietly] It's "Fizzlepop Berrytwist".
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Okay! That is the most awesome name ''ever!''

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, good. We're all here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So everypony got an urgent summons to the castle with no explanation?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yup! I just love a good mysterious summons. What's it about? Do you think it's a surprise party? Hey! Why are we running?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Because something could be terribly wrong! Somepony turned bad? Another evil creature back for revenge?!
:'''Applejack''': Don't you think you're bein' a little paranoid?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Why else would the Princesses send scrolls in such a hurry?
:'''Rarity''': Good point. They know better than to make us worry.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Plus, I like it when you run so fast, the walls get all blurry! Wheeee!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Race ya!
:[bouncing]

:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [panting]
:'''Spike''': [yelps]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Girls. Thank you so much for coming.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What's wrong?! What can we do?!
:'''Princess Luna''': That's just it. Nothing's wrong! Everything's perfect!
:'''Applejack''': Did y'all call us down here just to tell us ''that''?
:'''Rarity''': With all due respect, majesties, you might want to save your ''urgent'' summons for matters that are a bit more... well, urgent!
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [giggling]
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, there is more to it. Equestria is currently enjoying its longest period of harmony in recent years.
:'''Princess Celestia''': And it's all thanks to you, Twilight. And your friends, of course.
:'''Spike''': Who, us?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, pshaw. [giggles]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's about time you noticed!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you!
:'''Princess Luna''': Because of your efforts, there's been less and less for us to do.
:'''Princess Celestia''': So, after much consideration, my sister and I have decided it is time for us... to retire!
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [gasp]
:[poof]
:'''Discord''': Breaking news! The royal princesses retiring! I have so many questions! Who'll take over? Who will run Equestria? Will it be someone tall, dark, and handsome? Or will it be the Lord of Chaos?
:[magic zaps]
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Oh, fine. Go with the obvious choice.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panicked noise]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're retiring?!
:'''Spike''': Princesses can retire?
:'''Princess Luna''': [chuckles] Of course we can. I for one am looking forward to a little R&R. Maybe a trip to Silver Shoals.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And you want ''me'' to take your place?!
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': Mm-hmm!
:'''Princess Luna''': With the help of your friends, of course!
:'''Princess Celestia''': We can't think of anypony more worthy. Over the years, we've watched you grow. You've faced task after task...
:'''Princess Luna''': ...challenge after challenge...
:'''Discord''': Countless adversities, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it...
:'''Princess Celestia''': And you've always prevailed.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you, but that doesn't mean that I'm— that ''we're'' ready to do what ''you'' do!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, of course you are. I realize this is a lot to take in, but—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nope! Makes perfect sense. We're awesome! [gasps] Does this mean we get all your powers?! Ooh, ooh! I call dibs on showing up in everypony's dreams!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can't be ready to step into their horseshoes just like that!
:'''Applejack''': Well, if the princesses think it's time to retire, we're not a bad choice. We always have Equestria's best interests at heart.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's a fair point... which should be taken into consideration when we have a round table discussion—
:'''Rarity''': Well, I'm in! Darlings, we'll all need a complete wardrobe update! And I would love to pick your brain about mane maintenance when you have a moment.
:'''Fluttershy''': As long as we all have each other, I'm sure we can do it!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yay! "Protectors of Equestria" on three! One... two...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] If you're all on board, I guess I am, too.
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': Protectors of Equestria!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It'll be a bit of an adjustment, but I imagine the transfer of power will be a lengthy process, which will—
:'''Princess Celestia''': Actually, we just need a few days to put together a little ceremony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh] A few ''days?!''
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But that's so soon! Shouldn't there be some sort of training program that lasts weeks? No, months? If not years?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Everything you've gone through over the years has been a training program.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, but there's gotta be a guide or a rulebook!
:'''Discord''': Yes, I have it right here. "How to Rule Equestria", by Nopony McPretendsmith.
:[beat]
:'''Princess Luna''': The friendship journal you wrote yourselves is a better guide than any we could provide.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating]
:'''Princess Celestia''': We have the utmost confidence in you.
:'''Princess Luna''': And we hope you have the same in yourself.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [still hyperventilating, hyperventilates into paper bag]
:'''Discord''': Oh, I'm absolutely certain she does.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I am ''not'' confident about this at all!
:'''Discord''': Well, that's what ''I'' thought. I was being sarcastic before.
:[spray bottle noises]
:'''Discord''': What? This is all so predictable. Now's the part where you all tell little Sparkle here that everything is going to be fine, but she won't believe you. Ugh. I don't need to be here for this.
:[poof!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's just... I know I said yes, but then they said "in a few days", and there's still so much to figure out! It's all happening so fast! [hyperventilating into paper bag] I think I need some— [sips water, gulps] Okay! I'll feel much better—
:'''Rarity''': —once you make a plan?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, wow. It's like you—
:'''Spike''': —knew you were going to react this way? We did.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Classic "Twilight-ing".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "Twilight-ing"? You... You made me a verb?
:'''Applejack''': It's not a bad thing. We just know you have a... process.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Stage one – you get big news and you're like "''Nooooo!''", but then you pace, and you chart, you worry...
:'''Fluttershy''': It's okay. You go ahead and "Twilight", and we'll be here for you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're all acting so calm! But this is a big deal! What do we do if something big happens and the princesses aren't there to help?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um, if you think about it, they literally almost ''never'' help.
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Huh.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''And'' we still always win! Like when Sombra almost took back the Crystal Empire, or when Chrysalis pretended to be Cadance, or when Tirek came back and absorbed all the magic, or the other time Chrysalis tried to take over, or with Cozy Glow and the school! [inhales] Am I missing anything?
:'''Rarity''': Pony of Shadows.
:'''Spike''': Starlight when she was evil.
:'''Fluttershy''': Discord when ''he'' was evil.
:'''Applejack''': Do Flim and Flam count?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': See? We've almost always done things without the princesses' help! Which makes sense ''now'', because it was all just training for you to take over!
:'''Spike''': And it worked! I mean, if you think about it, there hasn't been a single villain that we couldn't defeat.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Phew!

:'''Queen Chrysalis''': One day, you'll see! I will defeat Twilight Sparkle and her friends! [cackles] And they will pay for stealing my kingdom!
:[magic zap]
:[whoosh]

:[scraping]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Psst, Tirek!
:'''Lord Tirek''': It is ''Lord'' Tirek. And what is it now?
:'''Cozy Glow''': I just wanna make sure you can see my best friends rock sculpture from over there!
:'''Lord Tirek''': [groans]
:[whooshing]
:[crumbling]

:[drip]
:[magic noises]
:[whirling]

:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Lord Tirek!
:'''Lord Tirek''': A changeling? [to Cozy Glow] See? She gets it.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Chrysalis, queen of the changelings! Or at least I ''will'' be, when I'm restored to my rightful place! Why did you summon me? What do you want?!
:'''Cozy Glow''': [yelps] Oh, golly! We didn't bring you! I thought ''you'' freed ''us'' from Tartarus!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Tartarus? Whoever pulled you from ''there'' must have been somepony very powerful indeed.
:'''King Sombra''': [laughs]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': King Sombra! You have returned? Why did you bring us here?
:'''Grogar''': He didn't.
:[whoosh]
:[thump]
:'''Grogar''': It was I. You may call me... ''Grogar''.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''' and '''Lord Tirek''': [gasps]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': ''The'' Grogar?
:'''Lord Tirek''': I thought that you were a legend!
:'''King Sombra''': I've heard of you.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Who?
:'''Grogar''': I assure you, I am ''very'' real. And you have all been brought here as part of ''my'' plan to rid Equestria of Twilight Sparkle and her friends once and for all. [laughs]

:'''Cozy Glow''': I am so sorry, but the name 'Grofar'? It just doesn't ring any bells.
:'''Grogar''': ''Grogar!'' I have been away too long if my name no longer strikes fear into the heart of one so tiny. Perhaps a demonstration of power is in order?
:[magic zaps]
:'''Lord Tirek''': [kisses] Grogar is ancient and extremely powerful. The land that would become Equestria was a mere collection of farms and pastures until he declared himself emperor of all he saw. I remember hearing tales of his tyranny when I was young.
:'''King Sombra''': I have also heard of the first Emperor of Equestria. The "Father of Monsters".
:'''Grogar''': I gave life to the foulest of creatures and allowed them to run wild, taking what they wanted and destroying the rest. My reign was a glorious, fear-soaked epoch of darkness in Equestria.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Ha! Until Gusty the Great rose up and banished you.
:'''Grogar''': That fool believed taking my bell would defeat me! But she only weakened me ''temporarily''.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Um, Tirek is ''really old'' – [to Tirek] no offense, you look great – [to Grogar] but if he knew about you when he was young, we have super different ideas about what "temporarily" means.
:'''Grogar''': ''Silence!'' I've spent millennia gathering power, biding my time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to seize control of Equestria! And watching all of ''you''. I've seen each of your humiliating defeats at the hooves of six puny ponies. And do you know why they've always bested you?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Because they cheat!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Because they are annoyingly lucky.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I'm just a kid, so...
:'''Grogar''': It is because they work ''together''. Where one is weak, another is strong, and thus unified, they are a formidable force! But we shall use their own strategy to defeat them.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': What are you suggesting?
:'''Grogar''': I suggest nothing. I ''demand'' that you join me, and together, Equestria will be ours!
:'''King Sombra''': I don't do "ours". I only do ''mine''. ''I'' will take back the Crystal Empire on my own, and ''I'' will destroy any pony who gets in ''my'' way!
:'''Grogar''': Such confidence. Go! Try to take back your kingdom. I shall send you there myself. If you prevail, you may keep it. But when you fail, you will submit to ''me''!
:'''King Sombra''': And if I refuse this deal?
:'''Grogar''': Then I shall return you to the darkness from which you were summoned.
:'''King Sombra''': Fine! But this is a waste of time, as I will crush those who defy me. I will defeat all who get in my way! I'm—
:[whoosh]
:'''Grogar''': I advise the rest of you to prepare to work together!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Well, working together sounds an awful lot like making friends, so... you two are in luck, because I know ''all'' about that!
:[twang]

:[knocking]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Twi! You in here? With the school closed for the summer, I didn't think anypony would be here—
:[paper rustling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So much to do, not enough time! No! I already did that! Wait, no, I didn't! Uggggh, not enough time!
:'''Spike''': [hushed] Help! She's spiraling! We're at the "my plan needs a plan" stage of a total Twilight meltdown!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [hushed] Oh, got it. [normal] Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Did I write down "eliminate redundant lists" on my School of Friendship to-do list or my personal to-do list?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Gah! Starlight! Oh, good, you're here! I need to talk to you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hang on, I had "talk to Starlight" written down on one of these. Just let me find it so I can cross it off! [worried noises]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow, you are "Twilight-ing" hard.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You say "Twilight-ing", too? Well ''excuuuuse'' me! This is the first time I've ever been asked to run a whole kingdom!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, you're right, you're right. [chuckles] So, what did you want to talk to me about?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah, here it is! I wrote it down. [reading non-stop] Starlight, you have blossomed into one of the strongest, smartest, most caring ponies I know, and I can't think of anypony better to leave in charge of my castle and the School of Friendship! So what do you think?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What?! You want ''me'' to take care of the castle and run the school?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh... I can't! I'm not ready! Remember what happened the last time you left me in charge?! And now you want me to do it ''permanently''?! What if I don't do the right things?! [hyperventilates] What if—?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight, get a hold of yourself! You've risen to every challenge you've ever faced. You can do anything you put your mind to. You've got this.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hah! And so do you. See what I did there? You just said everything ''you'' need to hear.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sarcastic laugh] Nice try. But running a school and running a country are two very different things. Now, if you don't mind I have seven thousand, four hundred, and thirty-two things to take care of before I become the new ruler of Equestria! [hyperventilates, hyperventilating into paper bag]
:'''Spike''': It was a valiant effort.

:[Crystal Ponies screaming]
:[crystals cracking]
:[shing]
:[magical zaps]
:[metal clinks]
:[crystals cracking]

:[door opens]
:'''Shining Armor''': The guard says Sombra's breached the castle!
:'''Princess Cadance''': Hurry, Twilight! We need you!
:[poof!]
:'''Princess Cadance''': Do you have Flurry Heart?
:'''Shining Armor''': I thought ''you'' had her.
:'''Shining Armor''' and '''Princess Cadance''': [gasp]
:[door opens]
:'''Flurry Heart''': Mama!
:'''Princess Cadance''': [gasps] You won't get away with this!
:'''King Sombra''': Oh, but I already have.
:'''Flurry Heart''': [angry noises]
:'''King Sombra''': [laughs]

:[crystals cracking]
:'''King Sombra''': With the Crystal Heart now in my possession, there is nothing to stop me from ruling the Crystal Empire!
:[chains clinking]
:'''King Sombra''': Kneel before Sombra! [sighs] Long live the king.

:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks for coming so quickly—
:[magic zap]
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasping]
:'''Discord''': Sure thing. But if you're gonna be the ruler of Equestria, you may want to work on your penmanship. This looks like it says, "Cadance sent an emergency message. Sombra's back, and he's taking over the Crystal Empire."
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's ''exactly'' what it says!
:'''Rarity''': But... But how is that possible?! I thought the Crystal Heart had dispelled him into the ether!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I have no idea! But he's back, and it's up to us to save the Empire and my family!
:'''Fluttershy''': Shouldn't somepony tell Celestia and Luna?
:'''Discord''': Ooh, good point! One of us should probably loop in the ''real'' rulers of Equestria.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. If we're going to run Equestria, we'll need to handle things like this on our own.
:'''Discord''': Oh, Twilight! Could this mean that you finally have the confidence to ascend to the throne like the princesses believe you can?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe? Unless you'd consider taking care of Sombra for us?
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Oh, no-no-no-no! You're absolutely right! You need to learn how to handle these things on your own. Ta-ta!
:[magic zap]
:'''Applejack''': Handlin' things on our own is all well and good, but last time we defeated Sombra with the Crystal Heart.
:'''Spike''': What if he has it already? How are we gonna stop him?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] With the Elements of Harmony! With those, we can defeat anypony! Even Sombra!
:'''Discord''': Ah, no-no-no. You didn't need the Elements the last time you defeated Sombra. And I'm not sure that using them still counts as "handling things on your own".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My family is in danger. I'm not taking any chances.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': She's got a point.
:'''Discord''': Ugh, fine.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What's his problem?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight, can you stay here and-
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [cutting off Twilight] -take care of the school? I've got you covered.

:[teleportation zap]
:[magic twinkling]
:[teleportation zap]

:'''King Sombra''': [chewing]
:[magic zap]
:'''King Sombra''': It's cute that you think that will do anything.
:'''Princess Cadance''': It might not, but they will!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Cavalry's here! [grunts]
:'''King Sombra''': [chuckles] How can I be surprised when I'm waiting to show all of you your greatest fear?
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp, groan]

:[clanks]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh...
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, Twilight. How disappointing.
:'''Princess Luna''': Equestria was in your care, and you let it be destroyed!

:'''King Sombra''': You should all surrender! Nothing can defeat your own fears!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We didn't need to defeat them. We just needed to face them long enough to distract you!
:[crystal cracking]
:'''King Sombra''': Nooooo!
:[magic zap]
:'''Shining Armor''': [mockingly] It's cute that you think that'll do anything.
:[magic zap]
:[explosion]
:'''King Sombra''': [growls] You may have won the battle, but ''I'' shall win the war!
:[magic zap]
:'''Spike''': Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We totally just wiped the castle with that guy!
:'''Shining Armor''': Thanks, Twily.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That was fun!
:'''Applejack''': And easy.
:'''Rarity''': As magical battles go, that was a cakewalk.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmm... Cakewalk...
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [giggle]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We ''did'' handle this pretty well. On our own.
:'''Spike''': Does this mean...?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I still don't feel like I'm one hundred percent ready, but will I ever?
:'''Applejack''': Knowing you? Nope.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I have you guys, and we have the Elements. And together, we've never failed. We'll be okay.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [assorted cheering]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Once again, Equestria is safe.
:'''Fluttershy''': What should we do to celebrate?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I vote for a cakewalk!
:[rumbling]
:'''Applejack''': What's goin' on?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know!
:[cracking]
:[shattering]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasps]
:'''King Sombra''': [laughs evilly]

:[Previously on My Little Pony]

:'''Princess Celestia''': It is time for us... to retire!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And you want ''me'' to take your place?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': With the help of your friends, of course.

:'''Grogar''': You may call me... Grogar. Together, Equestria will be ours!

:'''King Sombra''': ''I'' will take back the Crystal Empire on my own!

:'''Spike''': How are we gonna stop him?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': With the Elements of Harmony! With those, we can defeat anypony!

:[rumbling]
:[shattering]
:'''King Sombra''': [laughs evilly]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''King Sombra''': [laughing maniacally]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What. Just. Happened?!
:'''Fluttershy''': The Tree of Harmony can't ''really'' be gone, can it?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It can't be!
:'''King Sombra''': But it is! You thought you defeated me, but you led me right to the source of your power. Now that it's destroyed, ''nothing'' can stop me!
:[clinking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': He's right... With the Elements gone, I don't know how we can defeat him!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Then we'll just have to beat him the old-fashioned way!
:[clinking]
:[magic zap]
:[crunching]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [straining]
:'''King Sombra''': Ha! You're no match for me! I will finally rule the Crystal Empire! [gasps] Wait... With you out of the way, I will rule ''all'' of Equestria!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No!
:'''King Sombra''': Oh, yes. And I think I know ''exactly'' where I'll start.
:'''Applejack''': Don't you dare say it!
:'''King Sombra''': Your sweet, little hometown.
:'''Rarity''': You leave Ponyville alone!
:'''King Sombra''': Or what? Without your Elements, it would be so easy to control you.
:[magic noises]
:'''Mane Six''': [yelps]
:'''King Sombra''': But there's no point. My conquering Ponyville is already your greatest fear! [laughs maniacally]
:'''Mane Six''': No!
:'''Fluttershy''': What do we do?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know! The Tree of Harmony grew the Elements! It kept the Everfree Forest under control! And now it's gone. Sombra will take over Equestria, and it's all my fault! I knew I wasn't ready to take the princesses' place, but I never thought I'd mess up ''this'' badly!
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What are you looking at me for?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This is usually when you say something funny to lift our spirits.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sorry. Nothing about this is funny to me.
:'''Rarity''': [tears up] I'm sorry. I'm trying to be strong, but I just can't bear to think about poor Sweetie Belle under the spell of that monster!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Or those sweet little Cake twins...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Or Spike, or Starlight...
:'''Fluttershy''': Or Angel... or anypony forced to do that monster's bidding!
:[splat]
:'''Applejack''': What the—? Twilight, what are you doin'?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We can't just stay here. I don't have a plan, and I don't know what I'm gonna do once we get out. But we can't sit here and let Sombra make slaves of everypony we love!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Let me help! I'm faster!
:[digging]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I like digging!
:[whrring]
:'''Fluttershy''': I've been known to get my hooves dirty!
:'''Applejack''': Move over, y'all!
:'''Rarity''': Normally, I wouldn't dream of digging, but right now, ''show me the muddy!''
:[digging]
:[whirring]

:'''Mane Six''': [gasps]
:'''Applejack''': Apple Bloom! It's me! Look at me, sugarcube! Twilight, you gotta free her! Please!
:[magic noises]
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [yelps] I... I can't! Without the Elements, my magic isn't strong enough to stop Sombra's! Spike! Spike, where are you going? Starlight?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [monotone] We must lay siege to Canterlot.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! Snap out of it, you two! You're stronger than his magic!
:'''Rarity''': Sweetie Belle, please stop! I can't get her to stop! I can't get her—!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': None of us can. We can't reach them!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams]
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sobbing] He made them bake a black licorice fruitcake that says "Congratulations to Our Favorite Supreme Emperor King Sombra" in green frosting! ''It's the ugliest cake I've ever seen!'' [sobbing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Twilight, this is bad! Like, ''really'' bad!
:'''Fluttershy''': [sobbing] I've never been so sad in my whole life!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know what to do! I don't know how to free them, but I don't know how to stop Sombra! Everypony was so sure I'd do such a great job! Well, this is exactly what I was afraid of! Could anything else possibly go wrong?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well... With the Tree of Harmony gone, the Everfree Forest could grow out of control and threaten the town!
:'''Rarity''': Darling, that's oddly specific.
:[crackling]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]

:[crackling]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Even if we figure out how to defeat Sombra and bring everypony back to Ponyville, if we don't stop the forest, there won't ''be'' a Ponyville to come back to!
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ahem.
:[clicking]
:'''Fluttershy''': For our friends!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': For our families!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': For our home!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': For Equestria!
:[crackling]
:'''Mane Six''': ''Equestria!''

:[whoosh]
:'''Royal guards''': [inhale]
:[magic zaps]
:'''King Sombra''': You! Break it down!
:[thuds]
:[crash]

:[door opens]
:'''King Sombra''': They've fled! Celestia and Luna are too cowardly to even ''stand'' against me! Equestria is ''mine''! [laughs maniacally]

:'''Mane Six''': [grunting]
:[magic zaps]
:[chopping]
:'''Fluttershy''': Come on, everypony! [shrieks]
:[crackling]
:[animals squeaking]
:'''Applejack''': We've been at this for hours, but it's just growin' back too fast!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We have to keep trying!
:[crackling]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': I know we're supposed to be able to handle things on our own, but I've never been happier to see two ponies in my whole life!
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Star Swirl''': Nopony is meant to handle this on their own!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Star Swirl! The Tree of Harmony, it's—!
:'''Star Swirl''': I know. I alerted the princesses as soon as I could. I felt it when it happened. Like part of my essence just ceased to be.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know what you mean. I'm sorry.
:'''Star Swirl''': Don't be. I've more than enough magic in me to keep the Everfree Forest under control.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can do that?
:'''Star Swirl''': The Pillars and I planted the Tree of Harmony. Who do you think kept the Forest under control before it did?
:[magic zaps]
:'''Star Swirl''': It will take time, but with the princesses' help, I can keep it at bay!
:[magic zaps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aw, yeah! Go get 'em, beardy!
:[magic zaps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sombra's back, and he's taken control of all of our friends!
:'''Princess Luna''': We've left Canterlot defenseless!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight, you must go! Defend Equestria, and we shall contain the forest.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': At least now we're back to just one problem!
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Mane Six''': [shrieks]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aw, everypony's all evilly!
:'''Royal guard''': [growls]
:'''Fluttershy''': Sombra's gonna force us to fight our way through our friends?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not if I can help it!
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, guess we need a different plan. Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know! I'm not prepared to fight against the citizens of Equestria! I guess that's one more thing I'm not ready to do...
:'''Applejack''': Well, we'd better figure out somethin' quick, because none of ''them'' seem to have a problem with it!
:[drawbridge lowering]
:'''Rarity''': [shrieks] Oh, sorry about this, Fancy Pants!
:'''Applejack''': We promise we'll let y'all out as soon as we can!
:[whooshing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ooh, will I go here? Or here? Or here, or there?!
:'''Fluttershy''': [pants] Huh?
:[ding!]
:[whoosh]
:[smack!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Gotcha!
:[whoosh]
:'''Fluttershy''': I don't know how long we can hold them off!
:'''Applejack''': And holdin' them off isn't what we need anyhow! We need to get inside!
:'''Rarity''': But we can't just leave them here, all possessed and Sombra-fied!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What do we do, Twilight?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know, but we can't stay here!
:[teleportation zap]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sorry we couldn't help our friends, but I didn't know what else to do.
:'''Applejack''': At least we're inside.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [unconvinced] Yeah! All we have to do now is defeat King Sombra! [nervous laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I... We...
:[splat]
:'''Discord''': [chewing] Oh, my. No Elements? No princesses? Seems like you're in a bit of a pickle! Or are you in... [snaps] ...more of a jam? [chewing] Mmm!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Discord! What are you doing here?!
:'''Discord''': [swallows] Well, I was going to hang these up all over the castle to celebrate your coronation, but apparently it's a bit premature.
:[pop]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm so glad to see you! We could really use some all-powerful Lord of Chaos help right now!
:'''Discord''': ''Moi''? Oh, I couldn't possibly.
:[trotting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, poodles!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Discord, please!
:'''Discord''': Oh, fine. [snaps] Just to be clear, I was really rooting for you to do this on your own and parlay that confidence boost into being the best protectors of Equestria you can be.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': A little less talking and a little more helping?!
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[splat]
:[door opening and closing]
:[splats]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Thank you, Discord!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know what we'd do without you!

:[magic zaps, crystals cracking]
:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, "King" Sombra! Time to give up the crown!
:'''King Sombra''': [laughs] Here to fight the good fight with nothing but your wits? Admirable, but foolish! [grunts]
:[splat]
:'''King Sombra''': [grunts]
:'''Discord''': Well, I guess it's on me to be the MVP today. I ''was'' betting on you, and I do hate being wrong. Although if you think about it, I ''am'' your friend, so maybe you win because friendship wins? Although Fluttershy should get most of the credit for that. She's my favorite.
:'''King Sombra''': [grunts]
:'''Discord''': [slow motion yell]
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] ''Discord!''
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasps]

:'''King Sombra''': [laughs] Not even the Lord of Chaos can stand against me! I am truly the most powerful creature in Equestria!
:[magic zap]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Discord!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We need you!
:'''Fluttershy''': [tearing up] Oh, please wake up, please wake up... [gasps] Discord!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm so glad you're okay! We can't beat him without you!
:'''King Sombra''': You couldn't beat me ''with'' him, either! [laughs]
:'''Discord''': [coughs] [weakly] It would appear that you're on your own. [ragged breath] [snaps] I have nothing left to give.
:'''Applejack''': That's it, then? We're doomed?
:'''King Sombra''': Of course you are. I can't believe it's taken you this long to realize it. Now, how shall I eliminate all this clutter in my throne room?
:'''Mane Six''': [growl]
:'''Discord''': [weakly] Listen to me. You don't need me. You don't need the princesses, and you certainly don't need the Elements. [coughs] Fluttershy, you will always be kind. Applejack, you will always be honest. Rarity, you'll always be generous. [ragged breath] And Rainbow Dash will be loyal as can be. Pinkie will always bring laughter wherever she goes. And Twilight... [coughs] you are and always will be the embodiment of magic. You lost sight of what's in front of you. You're here, together, willing to give everything you've got for Equestria. Nothing and nopony can ever take that away from you, because that's who you are.
:'''King Sombra''': [laughs] It's going to take more than a sentimental speech to save you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Discord's right. We've proven time and time again that the real magic is the six of us working together! With these girls by my side, I'm not afraid of you! I'm not afraid of what you can do or how much power you have!
:'''King Sombra''': You should be.
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You may knock us down, but we're gonna get back up again!
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And again!
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And again! As long as we're together, we will ''never'' stop trying to defeat you!
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [straining]
:'''Fluttershy''': For our friends!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': For our families!
:'''Mane Six except Twilight Sparkle''': For our home!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': For Equestria!
:[magic noises]
:'''King Sombra''': [grunts] No! This can't be possible! Your magic can't defeat mine! ''I destroyed the source of your power!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can't destroy our friendship, Sombra!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And we keep telling bad guys.
:'''Applejack''': But y'all just don't seem to remember.
:'''Mane Six''': Friendship ''is'' magic!
:[magic explosion]
:'''King Sombra''': ''Noooooooooo!''
:[crystal cracking]
:[boom]

:[door opens]
:'''Fluttershy''': Aw, do you want more juice?
:'''Discord''': [weakly] Only if it's not too much trouble. And it's red. And it has one of those little umbrellas. And two cherries. No, no, actually, make it three. And maybe, uh... some donuts?
:'''Princess Celestia''': I see you've made yourselves at home.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Celestia! Luna! I know what you're going to say. I should have called on you as soon as I knew how dangerous it was. A good leader knows when to ask for help, and I didn't. And because of me, the Tree of Harmony was destroyed. Equestria deserves somepony much better than me as its leader.
:'''Princess Celestia''': You're right.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Princess Celestia''': About ''one'' thing. A good leader knows when to ask for help, but a ''great'' leader has the courage to admit when they've made a mistake and the strength to make it right. Today, you've proven to me beyond any doubt that you will be a great leader.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Will be?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Luna and I have decided it may have been a bit unfair to thrust this upon you without giving you the time you need to prepare.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Thank goodness! I really wasn't ready!
:'''Discord''': Not ready?! So, Twilight's not taking over?! This was all for nothing?! I pretended to be very hurt and gave one of the most convincing speeches of my—?!
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Pretended?!''
:'''Discord''': Of course! You don't think some "would-be king" could actually hurt the Lord of Chaos, do you? Anyway, as I was saying, I pretended to be very hurt to convince you that you didn't need anything but yourself to be the incredible leader I know you can be. And now it's not happening?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': It will. But when she's ready.
:'''Discord''': How can she not be ready?! What a waste of a perfectly wonderful speech! Ugh! Honestly, I don't know why I even bother.
:'''Rarity''': Ugh! So he could have ended the whole Sombra thing whenever he wanted?
:'''Fluttershy''': But he didn't, because he cares.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's Discord for ya.
:'''Applejack''': He sure has a weird way of bein' supportive.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Super odd dude.
:[magic zap]
:'''Discord''': I heard that!
:[magic zap]
:'''Mane Six''', '''Princess Celestia''', and '''Princess Luna''': [laughing]
:'''Princess Luna''': Also, truth be told, Celestia and I had fun today fighting side-by-side with Star Swirl for our home. It's been years since we've gotten to do what you girls do. You all make it look so easy.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, we are kind of an awesome team.
:'''Fluttershy''': Every adventure is heart-pounding, but so rewarding.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm up for anything, as long as it's with all of you!
:'''Rarity''': [giggles] Life certainly hasn't been dull since we met.
:'''Applejack''': Nowhere else I'd rather be.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We are pretty incredible together. And we would do anything for Equestria. I guess I know, when the time comes, as long as we're together, we probably—
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [clearing throats]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We ''definitely'' got this.
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': Awww!

:'''Cozy Glow''': Now I'll say something nice about centaurs. Tirek, you say something nice about changelings. And Chrysalis, you say something nice about ponies!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Never!
:'''Grogar''': Let us hope the three of you will be enough for my plans.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': And what of King Sombra?
:'''Lord Tirek''': Did he succeed?
:'''Grogar''': Hah!
:[magic noise]
:'''Grogar''': I'd say he gambled and lost! But at least he can serve as a warning to those who doubt continuing with my plans. Unless any of ''you'' have doubts.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Uh, not I.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Nope!
:'''Cozy Glow''': I'm good!
:'''Grogar''': Then we shall join forces and work together to bring Equestria to its knees! [laughs]
:'''Cozy Glow''', '''Queen Chrysalis''', and '''Lord Tirek''': [nervous laughter]

:[zooming]
:[thud!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Congratulations, Silverstream! You're officially the first non-Pegasus Wonderbolt!
:'''Silverstream''': Really?! That is such an honor! I don't know how to thank you, Professor Dash!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Easy! You're kicking off our show right now! So get up there and make me proud!
:[whoosh!]
:'''Silverstream''': Wait! I don't have my uniform!
:'''Ocellus''': Silverstream! Somehow, I missed a class all year, and the final is today! If I don't pass, I can't graduate!
:'''Yona''': [screaming]
:[beat]
:'''Yona''': [sighs]
:'''Ocellus''': Whoa. That was weird.
:'''Silverstream''': And ''that's'' even weirder.
:'''Smolder''': [sips, sighs] Hmm? Uh, this isn't mine!
:'''Gallus''': [screams] Make it stop! Make it stop! [hyperventilating] Huh?
:'''Sandbar''': [panicked noises]
:[magic sounds]
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle|Tree of Harmony}}''': Good. You have all answered my summons.
:'''Silverstream''': Wait. You mean this isn't ''my'' dream?
:'''Yona''': Friends must be dreaming together!
:'''Gallus''': More like a nightmare!
:'''Sandbar''': I know, right? How do I pick just one? They all look so good!
:'''Smolder''': ''That's'' your version of a bad dream?
:'''Ocellus''': But why did you bring us here, Headmare Twilight?
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle|Tree of Harmony}}''': I am not Twilight. I am merely the messenger. You all must hurry. The Tree of Harmony needs you.
:[smash!]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Young Six''': [gasp]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[squeaking]
:'''Spike''': [clicks tongue] Lookin' good.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike! I have horrible news!
:'''Spike''': What's wrong? Is the Crystal Empire under attack again?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What? No! We only have twenty highlighters! And they're all orange! How will everycreature color-code their notes?!
:'''Spike''': I'm pretty sure you're the only one that does that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Still, twenty isn't enough for the new school year!
:'''Spike''': We got plenty of time to order more. The friendship students won't be back until—
:[doors open]
:'''Spike''': Uh, now?
:'''Yona''': Whoa, whoa, whoa!
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, this is a surprise. Why are you all here so early? Did I send out the wrong back-to-school date?!
:'''Smolder''': Oh, we're not here for school.
:'''Sandbar''': Yeah. We're back 'cause the Tree of Harmony called us here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Gallus''': Don't feel bad it didn't reach out to you. We kinda have a special connection with it after last year.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But the Tree couldn't have called you. It's gone! Sombra destroyed it!
:'''Young Six''': [gasp]
:'''Spike''': Mmmmaybe next time, ease in with those truth bombs.
:'''Sandbar''': W-What about the Elements of Harmony?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Those are gone, too.
:'''Ocellus''': But doesn't that mean the Everfree Forest will take over Equestria?!
:'''Spike''': We've got that part under control, and Sombra won't be coming back, so... some good news, right?
:'''Silverstream''': Can we see the Tree ourselves? Or what's left of it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': As long as you promise to stick together. The Castle of the Two Sisters isn't the safest place, as you may remember.
:'''Yona''': Yona not scared of puckwudgies anymore! Friends save whole school from evil Pegasus!
:'''Spike''': [aside, to Twilight] She does have a point.
:'''Young Six''': [laughing]
:'''Ocellus''': Yes!

:'''Young Six''': [gasp]
:'''Gallus''': How could this happen?!
:'''Ocellus''': [gasps] If only we hadn't gone home for summer break. Maybe we could've saved the Tree.
:'''Smolder''': [huffs] I wish that Sombra guy was still around, so we could teach him a lesson!
:'''Yona''': That not bring back Tree. Or Elements of Harmony.
:'''Silverstream''': [gasps] Wait! We all saw and heard the Tree in our dream, right? How could it talk to us if it was really gone? Maybe if we close our eyes and think really strong friendship thoughts, the Tree will get better!
:'''Smolder''': Eh, I've heard worse suggestions.
:[music]
:[beat]
:'''Sandbar''': [loud whisper] Is it working?
:'''Yona''': No.
:'''Ocellus''': I guess the Tree really ''is'' gone.
:'''Gallus''': Then we need to do something to honor it!
:'''Smolder''': Ah, good idea, Gallus!
:'''Sandbar''': Hey, maybe ''that's'' why the Tree called us! It must've used the last of its magic to make sure we'd come here and keep its memory alive!
:'''Ocellus''': It did say it needed us.
:'''Thorax''': Ocellus!
:[transformation noise]
:[thud]
:'''Thorax''': There you are! The hive has been worried sick! Why did you leave without telling us? The last time you and your friends did that, it almost brought our kingdoms to war!
:[transformation noise]
:'''Ocellus''': Uh, sorry, Thorax! It was an emergency!
:'''Thorax''': Well, next time, ask before you run off. Now, come on. Let's go home.
:'''Smolder''': Wait! She can't leave! We have a... dragon quest!
:'''Thorax''': But she's not a dragon.
:[transformation noise]
:'''Thorax''': You know what I mean.
:[transformation noise]
:'''Yona''': This quest for ''all'' Yona friends! Need to help Tree!
:'''Sandbar''': And it might take a while.
:'''Silverstream''': Can we stay, Headmare Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, as long as you get permission from your kingdoms, I suppose it's all right.
:'''Gallus''': You want that permission in triplicate, or is one enough?
:[beat]
:'''Gallus''': What? I like to be prepared.

:[dragons yelling]
:'''Smolder''': [straining] Yah!
:[dragons cheering]
:'''Smolder''': [laughs]

:[montage music]

:'''Yona''': [snorts]

:[knocks on door]
:'''Grampa Gruff''': [coughs]
:[door slams]

:[music continues]

:[inaudible dialogue]

:'''Sandbar''': Hey, you're back! Great! Since I live locally, I figured I'd do a little cleaning up while you were gone. Give us a head start, you know?
:'''Rest of Young Six''': [gasp]
:'''Gallus''': Sandbar, where's the Tree?
:'''Sandbar''': I got rid of it, to make room for a memorial.
:'''Smolder''': ''You'' did this?!
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, yeah. That's what you guys were thinking, right?
:'''Smolder''': [smack]
:'''Silverstream''': So not.
:'''Ocellus''': How can we remember the Tree if it's totally gone?!
:'''Sandbar''': Oh, it's not gone. Look! I planted a new tree. [grumbles]

:'''Ocellus''': Sandbar, you know that's not the same tree, right?
:'''Sandbar''': But it's a symbol, y'know?
:'''Yona''': Pony heart in right place.
:'''Gallus''': [growls] That doesn't matter! This cave was supposed to stay exactly the same so that future creatures could come visit and experience the memory of the Tree!
:'''Sandbar''': Sorry, everycreature. I thought I was helping.
:'''Smolder''': The Tree of Harmony is a huge part of Equestrian history. If we're gonna honor it, we need to do better than ''that''.
:'''Silverstream''': Yeah! Like with lots of artwork that represents the symbolism and deep emotions of the Tree!
:'''Gallus''': No! It should be a museum with all the Tree's history and artifacts.
:'''Smolder''': Or a really big and imposing monument, so everycreature knows how powerful the Tree was!
:'''Ocellus''': I think we should turn this cave into a place for creatures to reflect on the Tree's true gift – the Elements of Harmony.
:'''Smolder''': Boring.
:'''Silverstream''': I like my idea better.
:'''Sandbar''': What's more perfect than another tree?!
:'''Ocellus''': What would Headmare Twilight want?
:'''Gallus''': Yona! You've been awfully quiet. Which idea do ''you'' like best?
:'''Yona''': Yona like when friends not argue. M-Maybe friends listen to each other and... make plan together?
:[beat]
:'''Rest of Young Six''': Naaaah.
:'''Yona''': [groans]

:'''Sandbar''': [to sapling] Hey, little guy. Need a drink?
:[water sprinkling]
:'''Gallus''': Step right up! Walk this way! Welcome to the one, the only, magical Tree of Harmony Museum! Come, see the birthplace of the Tree! Grown from the tears of a basilisk and tended day and night by pony magicians! This is truly one of the wonders of Equestria!
:'''Yona''': Uh, Gallus? None of that actually true.
:'''Gallus''': So? Honoring the Tree means giving it a story that creatures will care about.
:'''Sandbar''': It already ''has'' a great story!
:'''Gallus''': Yeah, but mine makes more sense.
:'''Sandbar''': Whatever. Can you just keep it down? My sapling doesn't like the noise.
:'''Gallus''': Good! It doesn't belong in the Tree's memorial anyway. [to tourists] ''And'' if you think ''this'' is great, just wait until you see the mystical Cave of Harmony!

:[scraping]
:'''Smolder''': [straining]
:[thud]
:[crunch]
:[whoosh]
:'''Yona''': What dragon doing?
:'''Smolder''': [straining] Making a memorial statue of the Tree. When creatures see this, they'll be super impressed!
:'''Yona''': Uh, look like rock, not tree.
:'''Smolder''': I'm not finished yet! And, honestly, I'm kinda having a hard time remembering what the Tree looked like. I can't believe I'm already forgetting.

:[painting noises, splats and splashes, etc.]
:'''Silverstream''': Hmmm... Needs more loyalty.
:[splash]
:'''Silverstream''': Careful, Yona! It's not dry yet.
:'''Yona''': What hippogriff painting?
:'''Silverstream''': It's the Tree, silly! See? These are the emotions its loss made me feel, dancing with the representations of Elements of Harmony!
:[beat]
:'''Silverstream''': Maybe I should label it.
:[creaking]
:[splash]
:'''Ocellus''': Oops! Sorry!
:'''Silverstream''': Oh, no! Brown isn't an Element of Harmony!
:[splashing]
:'''Ocellus''': [straining] Thanks, Yona! This fountain is heavier than I thought.
:[thud]
:[wind chimes]
:[transformation zap]
:'''Ocellus''': It's for creatures to look at as they honor the Tree's memory in quiet thought and contemplation. I got some help and guidance from the counselor at our feelings forum back home. Only positive energy will bloom here.
:'''Gallus''': Wait! You can't go yet!
:'''Tourists''': [gasps]
:'''Gallus''': There's a whole puppet show of the time the Tree tested us in the catacombs under the School of Friendship! [to Smolder] Hey, stop! You can't bring that hunk of junk into my museum!
:'''Smolder''': It's not for ''your'' museum. It's for ''my'' tree memorial.
:'''Gallus''': So leave it outside!
:'''Smolder''': It belongs in ''here''!
:[crunch]
:[crash]
:[splash]
:'''Silverstream''': [gasps]
:[rumbling]
:'''Yona''': [gasps]
:[crash]
:'''Gallus''': Uh-oh.
:'''Silverstream''': [gasps] What did you do?!

:[water flowing]
:'''Ocellus''': My meditation garden is ruined! Why couldn't you've been more careful?!
:'''Gallus''': This never would have happened if you had all just listened to me!
:'''Sandbar''': And made the Tree some kind of roadside attraction?! Uh, no thanks!
:'''Silverstream''': [hyperventilating into paper bag] Headmare Twilight is gonna be so mad when she sees what you guys did to the Cave of Harmony!
:'''Smolder''': Yeah, like some rainbow art project was better?
:'''Sandbar''': Not cool!
:'''Silverstream''': It's impressionism!
:'''Ocellus''': I'm just glad the Tree isn't here to see this.
:'''Smolder''': This is all ''your'' fault!
:'''Gallus''': I give up!
:'''Yona''': [grunts] ''Quiet!'' [stomps] Friends doing this the wrong way. All remembering Tree of Harmony for what Tree ''was'', not what Tree ''is''!
:'''Smolder''': You mean 'gone'?
:'''Yona''': No! Yona mean even though Tree not here here, Tree ''here''. In hearts. Tree made friendship even closer.
:'''Ocellus''': That's right! We ran away to be together right above this spot! The Castle of the Two Sisters!
:'''Sandbar''': And later on, the Tree tested us to show us we're stronger as a team!
:'''Smolder''': It ''did'' call us all here.
:'''Silverstream''': [gasps] You mean the Tree of Harmony lives on in our friendship!
:'''Gallus''': Wow. I can't believe we just got schooled by a yak.
:'''Yona''': Yaks know things not forever. That's why smash and rebuild.
:'''Ocellus''': I think we took care of the smashing part.
:'''Gallus''': Then maybe we should start building. Together?
:'''Smolder''': Just one problem. We still haven't decided what we should do for the Tree.
:'''Yona''': Yona have idea.
:[clanking]
:'''Ocellus''': The Tree! Where did you find it?!
:'''Sandbar''': Oh, I didn't move it ''too'' far.
:[beat]
:'''Sandbar''': It was kinda heavy.
:'''Gallus''': And you're just mentioning this ''now''?
:'''Yona''': What important is that Yona bring back branches so friends can rebuild!
:'''Smolder''': Rebuild what, exactly?
:'''Silverstream''': Ooh-ooh-ooh, I know! Something that represents what the Tree ''is''! The gateway to our friendship!
:'''Yona''': Yes! What ponies call it? Club... home?
:'''Gallus''': A treehouse!
:'''Ocellus''': [gasps] That's a great idea!
:'''Smolder''': I know the Tree would've liked that!
:'''Yona''': Uh-huh!
:[transformation zap]
:'''Sandbar''': [straining] Help me lift this piece!
{{#lst:The Place Where We Belong|song}}
:'''Sandbar''': Well? What do you think?
:'''Ocellus''': It's, uh... kinda messy...
:[bat squeaking]
:'''Smolder''': Yeah... like a bunch of different parts all smushed together.
:'''Silverstream''': Oh, it's just like us!
:'''Yona''': Yona think it perfect!
:'''Gallus''': Let's give it a try.
:[thud]
:'''Young Six''': [giggling]
:[rumbling]
:'''Sandbar''': Whoa! What's happening?!
:'''Ocellus''': It looks like magic!
:'''Smolder''': Everycreature out!
:'''Young Six''': [panicked panting]
:[rumbling and creaking]
:[crunch]
:[creaking]
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Young Six''': [gasps] Whoa!
:'''Gallus''': How did ''that'' happen?
:[glow]
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle|Tree of Harmony}}''': Because of you. The spirit of the Treehouse would have perished without your selfless deeds and caring. Whenever you seek solace, come here. Your friendship, and the friendship of future generations, will always be safe within these walls.
:[magic zap]
:[door opens]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I felt a burst of magic all the way over at the school! Is everycreature okay?
:'''Silverstream''': A little confused, but definitely okay!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Where did ''this'' come from?
:'''Smolder''': We were kinda gonna ask you the same thing.
:'''Spike''': It looks like part of the Tree of Harmony. But how? I thought it was destroyed!
:'''Ocellus''': It was. But when we used the broken parts to build something new, this happened.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Tree has always been good at surprises. When Star Swirl planted the Tree's seed, he didn't even know what it would grow into. I guess the Tree is still alive, changing and adapting to be whatever Equestria needs.
:'''Gallus''': A cool place to hang out?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Something tells me this is more than that. It seems the Elements of Harmony may still be with us in their own way.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] That's actually really reassuring.
:'''Silverstream''': But why did the Tree need ''our'' help to become something new?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm not sure. If I had to guess, I'd say your friendship is more powerful than you know.
:'''Yona''': Oh, Yona know. Yona just need to remind friends.
:'''Spike''': So, who's gonna give us the tour?
:'''Young Six''': [umm-ing and uhh-ing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggles] Why don't we all go in together?
:'''Young Six''': [laughing]

:'''Spike''': Twilight! Look at this scroll I just got!
:[fanfare plays]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Do you know what this means?
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, I don't. What's so exciting about a toy crown?
:'''Spike''': [laughs] This is no "toy crown". It's the hard-won helm of the Sibling Supreme!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': When Shining Armor and I were small, we competed over everything.

:[wind blowing]
:[montage music]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [voiceover] To keep it friendly, our parents gave us gold stars every time we did something special. Sharing... getting good grades... even telling a really funny joke. And at the end of each week, we'd add up the stars. The sibling with the most would win the Crown of the Sibling Supreme — ''and'' bragging rights — 'til next time.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Guess that explains your love of charts and so much else.
:'''Spike''': I always wanted to be Sibling Supreme one day. [reading] "Meet me at Celestia's castle to decide who deserves the crown once and for all."
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': Race you there!
:[door opening and closing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Guess I'll watch the school?

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:[fanfare]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're ''wearing'' it?!
:'''Shining Armor''': Look, I know you've always held a grudge because I left home with this.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Grudge? [scoffs] What grudge? Just because you've had it for ''way'' longer than you should have and I never got a chance to win it back!
:'''Princess Celestia''': With the return of Sombra, Princess Luna and I felt it was time to reinforce the castle's defenses.
:'''Princess Luna''': ''I'' said we could do it ourselves, but some ponies are a bit stubborn.
:'''Princess Celestia''': So ''I'' asked our old Captain of the Guard to handle the job.
:'''Shining Armor''': I've taken the security here to a whole new level. The only thing I need now is somepony to test it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] You want me to break into Celestia's castle?
:'''Shining Armor''': If you can get past my defenses, steal the crown, and get out, you'll be Sibling Supreme forever!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': For-ev-er...
:'''Shining Armor''': ''But!'' If you fail, I keep the crown.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Deal! Wait. Are you sure this counts? Mom and Dad aren't giving us any stars.
:'''Princess Celestia''': I will represent their authority. And thank you, Twilight. Your help will reveal if there are any holes in our security.
:'''Princess Luna''': [nickers]
:'''Shining Armor''': And there aren't. I've designed a multi-tiered, impenetrable, triple-backed-up line of defense.

:'''Shining Armor''': [voiceover] The castle is surrounded by shards of Queen Chrysalis' throne. Thanks to Star Swirl, its anti-magic powers are now tuned to stop anycreature from using a spell to get inside. You can't ''fly'' in, either.
:[fans whirring]
:'''Shining Armor''': [voiceover] Giant fans keep anycreature from flying too close to the castle.
:[bird squawks]
:[bricks clink]
:'''Shining Armor''': [voiceover] Plus, the entrances to the tunnels below the castle have been sealed, so there's no underground access. And even if you ''could'' get in — which you can't — I've doubled the ranks of security. Ponies protect every hallway and door, which can only be opened with royal guard medals.

:'''Shining Armor''': Even if you brought an army, the throne room is the safest spot in Equestria. I rigged a floor trap to activate at the slightest touch.
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Shining Armor''': But say you avoid the floor — still no luck, because I've employed ''nature's'' alarm system.
:[geese honking]
:'''Spike''': Geese?
:'''Shining Armor''': You can hear their honks all the way in Ponyville.
:[goose honks, snaps]
:'''Shining Armor''': Plus they bite. [nervous laugh]
:[goose honks]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So that's what we're up against.
:'''Applejack''': Whew. That's a barrel and a half of obstacles. Plus a bushel and a peck of impenetrability.
:'''Rarity''': And all of this to win some fillyhood competition with your brother?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's ''more'' than that! Okay, it's exactly that. And to protect Celestia's castle!
:'''Fluttershy''': If it means that much to you, Twilight, we're in.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I was ''already'' in! Come on, who doesn't want to hang with geese?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Of course we'll help. But how?
:'''Spike''': Shining Armor may have come up with some great security, but he'll never guess Twilight's plan.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We play to our strengths and defeat all of the security measures. That way, if one of us fails, the others will still have a shot at getting the crown. Pinkie, you'll distract the guards with a surprise party.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yes, sir, Twilight, sir!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Applejack, you'll buck your way into the sealed tunnels. Rainbow Dash, if anypony can outfly those wind turbines, it's you. Rarity, you'll sew us guard costumes so we can sneak past security. Then Fluttershy will disable the throne room alarm by charming the geese.
:'''Spike''': [belches]
:[poof!]
:'''Spike''': It's from Shining Armor. [reading] "Dear Twily, hope your idea isn't just..." [indistinct muttering] Tunnels? He guessed your whole plan!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?! Pinkie party, Rarity costumes... "Signed, the future Sibling Supreme"?! Oh, come on! [grumbles]
:'''Rarity''': Twilight, darling, nopony knows you better than your own brother.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So you're saying I should give up?
:'''Rarity''': I'm saying your brother ''will'' win. No matter how brilliant your plan is, no matter how many variations you try, it will be something your brother expects, and he'll always win! Unless... when the perfect chance comes along, you do something he ''can't'' expect. Then ''you'll'' win.
:'''Spike''': You've been practicing that speech, haven't you?
:'''Rarity''': A little bit. It felt like I rushed. Did I rush it?
:'''Applejack''': Absolutely not.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, no.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, it was fast-ish.
:'''Rarity''': We have to do the opposite of what Shining Armor expects. Therefore, Twilight cannot mastermind the plan. ''But I can!''
:'''Applejack''': That's... definitely unexpected.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, how is ''you'' making a break-in plan the opposite of Twilight doing it?
:'''Rarity''': Because ''my'' plan is for each of us to devise our own unexpected part of it. Allow me to demonstrate.
:[magic sounds]
:[harp flourish]

:[indistinct talking]
:[film noir music]
:[silence]
:'''Rarity''': We're looking for a pony with information.
:[zoom!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We got questions, and you're gonna serve us up some answers, juice jockey!
:'''Rarity''': Where is the secret entrance to the passages under Canterlot Castle?
:'''Server Pony''': Shining Armor sealed 'em all. There's no secret entrance.
:'''Rarity''': There's always a secret entrance!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So make like a glass of O.J. and spill!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh, ooh, ooh! I know what ''I'' can do!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [voiceover] You're gonna need a lookout, so I can be your eye in the sky. [on-screen] Too low, silly! Up here!
:[jangle pop music]
:'''Saturn''': [laughs] Oh, Pinkie! That tickles! [laughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs]

:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?
:'''Applejack''': How about somethin' a little more down-to-earth? Like, I distract the guard ponies with a farewell performance by my alter ego, famous country-western superstar Apple Chord!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I didn't know you had an alter ego. And why would she be giving a farewell performance?
:'''Applejack''': Well, it's a long story.

:'''Applejack''': [voiceover] Back on the farm, playin' music was about makin' her family smile. Word of her talent spread, and soon, Apple Chord was playin' ''real'' shows.
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Applejack''': [voiceover] The more she played, the bigger those shows got.
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Applejack''': [voiceover] But she missed playin' for her family... So one day, she gave it all up. Seein' her family smile was all she ever wanted from her music.

:'''Applejack''': Of course, Apple Chord could come out of retirement for a farewell concert this one time.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait. Did you just make all that up, or did that actually happen?
:'''Applejack''': Um...
:'''Rarity''': Doesn't matter. It's perfect. Fluttershy? Spike?
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, I guess the opposite of what ''I'm'' good at is... [gasps] ...being in small spaces.
:'''Spike''': I always wanted to be a super-spy. Is ''that'' the opposite of anything?

:[metal clanging]
:'''Spike''': Special Agent Fluttershy, target detected below.
:'''Fluttershy''': It's almost too easy.
:[''Mission Impossible''-esque music]
:[laser sounds]
:[explosions]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-mm. I guess I'm the only one left that still needs a plan.
:'''Rarity''': [laughing] Oh, no, darling. That ''is'' the plan. You shall do nothing!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Spike''': Shining Armor definitely won't expect that.

:[music]
:[fans whirring]
:'''Shining Armor''': Applejack? What are you doing?
:'''Applejack''': Applejack? [laughs] Who's that? ''My'' name's Apple Chord, and I've got a couple of songs to play for ya. Clap your hooves if you know 'em! And a one, and a two, and a...
::My love is like a barrel
::A barrel full of hay

:[wind blowing]
:[hot air activating]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The Wonderbolts did a fly-by, and the only way past those giant fans and into the castle ducts is here. But there's no room for mistakes!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Just like space travel!
:'''Fluttershy''': Uh, Pinkie? We're not actually going ''into'' space, right?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles] No, silly! I'm dropping you two off as soon as we're close to the fans! Then ''I'm'' going into space!

:[thud]
:'''Shining Armor''': You're up to something, Twily.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nope. Just looking at the flowers. [sniffs, sighs]
:'''Shining Armor''': [unconvinced] Right.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sniffs] Ooh! Maybe Rarity's plan ''will'' work!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Canterlot! We have a problem! [screams]
:'''Applejack''': I know that one's a crowd favorite. What say we play it one more time? And a one, and a two, and a—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screaming]
:'''Applejack''': [quietly] A distraction's a distraction.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Where's Spike and Fluttershy? Did they make it into the castle?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': They jumped out right before the balloon went [blows raspberries] but that's all I could see without being in space, where I didn't get to go!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's hope Rarity and Rainbow Dash had better luck.

:'''Rarity''': What's this? Closed?!
:'''BeauDe Mane''': Oh, the seedy juice joint is ''always'' closed around this time.
:'''Rarity''': Then how are we meant to shake down ne'er-do-wells for information?!
:'''BeauDe Mane''': What sort of information do you need?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um, the location to a secret entrance to the passages under Canterlot Castle.
:'''BeauDe Mane''': You mean that one?
:'''Rarity''': Yes, thank you. That will do nicely.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Zephyr Breeze?!
:'''Rarity''': Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, darling, this couldn't be more perfect!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How is this perfect?! He's the most annoying pony in Equestria, and he's totally obsessed with me, and we have to come up with a way to distract— Oh, no. Oh, no-no, no way! Unh-unh!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs]
:'''Zephyr Breeze''': [slurps] Wha...? Rainbow! I knew you'd come running when you heard I got this job! The mares love a pony in uniform, am I right?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not really. I mean, eh, totally. Why don't you step into the light so I can see how... ugh... handsome you look in it?
:[film noir music]
:'''Rarity''': [grunting]
:'''Zephyr Breeze''': I told the sarge that gold kinda clashes with my aura, but apparently, they aren't big on input. Still, I totally managed to rock the look, don't you think?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yep. You're real guard material.
:'''Zephyr Breeze''': I'm part of the castle team now, so I'm basically— Whoa! We got a swooner! [seductively] It's good you're finally being honest with your feelings for me, Rainbows.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gags] Blech.
:'''Zephyr Breeze''': The truth is such a gift. Like, I had to follow my bliss to see guarding is my calling. Like, look at me go. I'm gonna walk over here, and I go whoo! Over there! And I go, "Yeah!" and sometimes, I just stand like this and look real cool, and I go down the hallway and go, "Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh!"

:[glass scraping]
:'''Spike''': [gasps, sighs]
:'''Fluttershy''': [hushed] We'll have to glide to the throne. No flapping.
:[goose grunts]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:[geese honking]
:[trapdoor opening and closing]
:[door opens]
:'''Princess Luna''': [distant] Sister! ''Another'' false alarm from Shining Armor's guard geese!
:[door shuts]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We should have heard by now! Something must have gone wrong!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Probably several somethings. [inhales, blows air]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No lookout, no distraction, and no word from the ponies inside! I'm starting to think this whole operation might be a giant flop!

:[geese honking]
:[scratching]
:'''Fluttershy''': [hyperventilating] Oh, no!
:'''Spike''': Gee, Fluttershy, I thought your whole small spaces thing was just part of the plan to be unexpected.
:'''Fluttershy''': Once, I got trapped in the Castle of the Two Sisters, and Angel Bunny and I were separated! Now whenever I'm in a tiny room, it's all I can think about! I was so worried he felt alone and forgotten!
:'''Spike''': [sighs] I know that that's like.
:'''Fluttershy''': What do you mean?
:'''Spike''': I was always excited to be a part of Twilight's and Shining Armor's rivalry, like I was their little brother. But they never really thought of me that way.
:'''Fluttershy''': I know they both have a special place in their heart for you, but sibling dynamics are hard. Trust me.
:'''Spike''': Right. Zephyr Breeze.
:'''Fluttershy''': Honestly, he could learn a lot from you about being a little brother.
:[rumbling]
:'''Rarity''': I am sick of being lost in these slimy corridors, too! But you shouldn't pull every lever you come across! Half of them are traps!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And the other half might open a secret passage to the castle!
:'''Rarity''': ''It's not worth the risk!'' Oh, hello, Spike. [to Rainbow Dash] Even if we did find our way back to the castle, we'd still have all of those guar— Spike? Fluttershy?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, what are you guys doing down here?
:'''Spike''': We, uh, kind of fell through the floor.
:'''Fluttershy''': I don't think our plan is working.
:'''Rarity''': We've both hit dead ends. Perhaps we should return to the outside and reevaluate.
:[mice squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': Eugh!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating]
:'''Spike''': Psssssst!
:[metal squeaking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What are you all doing out here?
:'''Rarity''': In retrospect, our plan might have been ''too'' unexpected.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Every part of it failed?! Oh, now I'll ''never'' get the crown!
:'''Spike''': Maybe we should go back to doing things the Twilight way.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You mean the totally expected way?
:'''Spike''': It may not be a surprise, but you have a pretty good record for planning things.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then I guess it's worth a try. Thanks, Spike.
:'''Spike''': What are little brothers for?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay! You all know what to do!

:[music]
:[balloon inflating]
:[pop!]
:[slide whistle]
:[guards chattering]
:'''Rarity''': At least one part of our expected plan worked unexpectedly.
:[door opens]
:[whooshing]
:'''Zephyr Breeze''': To be fair, it was never made specifically clear to me what "guarding" actually means, so this is on you.
:'''Applejack''': I'm strong, Twilight, but not even I can buck through solid rock.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's why I brought a specialist.
:[tapping]
:[chalk drawing]
:[joints cracking]
:[crunch]

:'''Rarity''': [deep voice] Next shift. You're on break.
:[whoosh]
:[thud]
:[door opens]
:[geese honking]
:'''Fluttershy''': You've been glaring so hard. Who wants a feather massage?
:[gesse quiet]

:'''Spike''': We mapped this out when we got lost down here. The lever to the secret hallway entrance should be... here.
:[click]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I can't believe this worked!
:'''Spike''': I guess sometimes the best plan is the one you expect!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All I have to do now is fly over and take the crown, and I'll be Sibling Supreme forever!
:'''Shining Armor''': Not exactly.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, come on!
:'''Shining Armor''': Gotta admit, it was unexpected for you to do everything exactly how I thought you would. But you should know by now there's no way to beat the true Sibling Surpreme!
:'''Princess Celestia''': I am sorry, Twilight, but it looks as though Shining Armor has truly won the crown.
:'''Spike''': That's the thing about looks. They can be ''deceiving''.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike?!
:'''Shining Armor''': How in Equestria did you do it?!
:'''Spike''': Come on. You two don't think you have the ''only'' sibling rivalry. I had an inside pony help.
:[dramatic music sting]
:'''Spike''': It wasn't hard to miss there were some disagreements on the whole security thing.

:'''Princess Luna''': [flashback] I said we could do it ourselves, but some ponies are a bit more stubborn.
:'''Spike''': [voiceover] So, while Shining Armor went on and on about his improved security measures, Luna and I struck a deal. She put Zephyr in charge of the catacombs and helped keep Celestia out of the castle hallways. Once Luna was on board, I just had to do ''my'' part and make sure we stuck to Twilight's plan so we'd all get to the throne room at the same time. I knew Shining Armor would let it play out until the last possible second. Then, while everyone was distracted by his gloating, all Luna had to do was float the crown over to me.

:[beat]
:'''Princess Celestia''': [clears throat] [forced] I, uh, apologize, for not listening to your concerns, sister. It seems we need to make adjustments to account for threats ''inside'' the castle as well as out. If you agree?
:'''Princess Luna''': [forced] If you think it's worth discussing.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So, if Twilight ''and'' Shining Armor failed, who gets the crown?
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The ''true'' Sibling Supreme. Spike.
:'''Spike''': Huh?
:'''Shining Armor''': The little brother we've always had.
:'''Mane Six''': Awww...

:[squeak]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Are you all right?
:'''Derpy''': We just had a really heavy delivery today.
:'''Spike''': Is it a deluxe set of special edition ''Ogres & Oubliettes'' figurines that I'm totally surprised by and have been hinting that I need forever?
:'''Derpy''': Well, it's for Twilight.
:'''Spike''': Awww...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you.
:'''Derpy''': You're welcome!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh. It's from Princess Celestia.
:'''Spike''': [belches] So is this. Really? She couldn't have put it into the box?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "My dearest Twilight, I have been conducting a thorough cleaning of the castle, and I came across a few items of yours in your old room. I thought you might want them back." I didn't even know I'd left anything! Awww, look! Remember this? It's the macaroni picture frame Cadance helped me make when I was a filly!
:'''Spike''': [quietly, sarcastic] Who could forget a masterpiece like that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My G1 Star Swirl figure! And some of my favorite school scrolls! ''And'' here's my extra extra credit report on "The Impediments of Using Magic in Everyday Chores"! Ha! Still so true!
:'''Spike''': Is my ''Smash Fortune'' comic in there? I've been looking for that for years. Whoa, whoa!
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': [muffled] Or this.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no! Oh, no! ''Oh, no!''
:'''Spike''': What's wrong? It just looks like an old library book.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Exactly! It belongs to the Canterlot Library! That means it's... overdue!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You don't understand, Spike! I have a perfect library book return record!
:'''Spike''': [clears throat] ''Had'' a perfect record.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] I've never turned in a book even a ''minute'' late! And ''this'' one has been overdue since I left for Ponyville!

:[stamping]
:'''Dusty Pages''': Make sure you bring this one back on time. We've got a long waiting list of ponies who can't wait to read it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I promise I won't let you down!
:'''Dusty Pages''': Oh, of course, you won't, dear. If there's anypony I can trust to take care of a book, it's you, Twilight Sparkle. After all, you still hold the "Best Book Borrower" title.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oooh! I hope I do forever!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spi-ike! Quick, find me that old copy of ''Predictions and Prophecies''. What's that for?
:'''Spike''': Well, it ''was'' a gift for Moon Dancer, but...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And then Celestia sent me to Ponyville, and I forgot all about this! Dusty Pages prided herself that no books were damaged or lost on her watch, and I failed her! I failed myself!
:'''Spike''': I take it we're going to Canterlot?
:[zip!]
:'''Spike''': [groans] The sooner, the better, I guess.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:[leaves rustling]
:'''Spike''': Uh, why are we hiding? Don't you wanna return your book?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes. But what if somepony sees me in there? I'm the Princess of Friendship. Everywhere I go, ponies recognize me. I'll stick out like a sore hoof.
:'''Spike''': [incredulously] Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library? Stop the presses!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A late book is a big deal, Spike. What if Dusty Pages revokes my library card? Or bans me from ever entering the building again?!
:'''Spike''': Don't you already have most of those books in your collection at home?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, but the ones in there have a special Canterlot Library-y smell!
:'''Spike''': You sniff books?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You ''don't?'' I used to ''live'' in a library. If I'm not a good example of proper book borrowing behavior, then what kind of princess ''am'' I?
:'''Spike''': One that makes mistakes like everypony else. Trust me. Once you return that book, you'll feel way better.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks, Spike. Let's go! [screams, giggles nervously]
:'''Spike''': [groans]

:[teleportation zaps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps, clears throat, deep voice] I have a book to return.
:'''Librarian Pony''': Princess Twilight! So good to see you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Librarian Pony''': Need some recommendations from the new release section?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Is that the new edition of Mooncurve's ''Seven Theories on Bending Time''? I have been waiting for the release sin— Uh, I mean, uh, no books today! [chuckles] Thanks!
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But I do need to speak with Dusty Pages about a... [clears throat] sensitive matter.
:'''Librarian Pony''': Dusty who?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh] Dusty Pages? The head librarian? She's worked here forever.
:'''Librarian Pony''': I'm sorry, princess. I don't know her. Now, was there some other way I can help the library's Best Book Borrower?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous giggle]
:'''Spike''': [hushed] Just ask where to return an overdue book! It's no big deal! It happens all the time!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hushed] Not to me it doesn't! [sighs] Fine. Fine! Oh, no! I didn't even think about the late fine! A book out this long will probably cost a thousand bits!
:'''Spike''': She— I mean, ''we'' have an overdue book.
:'''Librarian Pony''': [laughs] Well, that's no problem at all. In fact, it happens all the time.
:'''Spike''': See?
:'''Librarian Pony''': I'll just find it in the card catalog. Uh, number one-eight-nine-oh-five, got it! [laughs] Oh, wow. Yeesh. I haven't seen a book this late in... well, ever. [clears throat] You need to go and see First Folio in the Grossly Overdue Book Return Office for Ponies Who Should Know Better.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't pull any punches with those names, do you?
:'''Spike''': And that office would be...?
:'''Librarian Pony''': In the basement. [whispering] Because of the ''shame''.
:[thud]

:'''Spike''': Whoa. [strains] Looks like nopony ever goes down here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Nopony except undependable rule-breakers who deserve all the horrors this hallway holds!
:'''Spike''': ''And'' faithful dragon companions. Uh... hey! It looks like First Folio left a note on the door!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "Abandon hope, all ye who enter"?
:'''Spike''': [reading] "Out to lunch on Restaurant Row." Guess we'll have to try back later!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! I can't wait another minute to return this book! In the time it took us to get there, I racked up another... seventeen bits in late fees! We're going to lunch!
:'''Spike''': Good, 'cause I'm starving! [licks lips]
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': Oh. You mean to find First Folio. Can we at least get takeout?!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Tell me if you see any librarian-type ponies.
:'''Spike''': Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And my late fines are already up another twenty-six more bits!
:'''Spike''': [mock-sobbing]
:'''Pretzel''': Waiter, we're ready to order.
:'''Spike''': Oh, uh, I'm not actually—
:'''Pretzel''': Three samosas, two curry specials... Do you think that's enough for the two of us?
:'''Spike''': Hm. Well, I would probably order some naan as well. For the table?
:'''Pretzel''': Sounds great.
:'''Moon Dancer''': Twilight? Is that you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Moon Dancer! How've you been? I'm just visiting. No real reason. Heh.
:'''Moon Dancer''': Well, it's good to see you! I'm just meeting my friend, First Folio, for lunch. Do you want to join us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': First Folio?! Yes! I mean, thank you.
:'''First Folio''': Princess Twilight, good to meet you! Did you know your picture is still up in our library as the Best Book Borrower?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah... I was hoping I could talk to Dusty Pages about that.
:'''Moon Dancer''': Oh, Dusty Pages left the library moons ago. Didn't you know?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-mm.
:'''First Folio''': Oh, I heard she was forced to leave. It's so sad. She loved the library.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait. Forced to leave?
:'''First Folio''': Yuh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. She had a perfect librarian record. Until one careless pony didn't return a book, ruined it all.
:'''Moon Dancer''': Are you okay, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervously] Uh-huh. Would, uh, you excuse me?
:[whoosh]
:[spinning]
:'''Spike''': That's why you only order spicy if you can take it. Twilight, what's wrong?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Dusty Pages isn't working at the library any more because ''I'' didn't return this book! Spike, I think ''I'' got her fired!

:[brake skids]
:'''Spike''': Twilight, the library is ''that'' way!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Change of plans. We're going to Dusty's house. She used to invite me over for tea all the time.
:'''Spike''': But what about your late fees?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They're not as important as making things right.
:'''Spike''': Wait. So you're ''not'' going to return the book?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. Dusty Pages is. It's my fault she lost her job. So if I give her the book, she can get her old job back. It'll fix everything! [sighs]
:[knocking]
:[door opens]
:'''Meathead Pony''': Didn't you see the sign? No salesponies!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I'm not selling anything.
:'''Meathead Pony''': No carolers either. No surveys, no petitions, no free literature...
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No problem. I'm just looking for somepony who used to live here. I'm pretty sure this was her house.
:'''Meathead Pony''': Dusty Pages?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes!
:'''Meathead Pony''': Hold on. She moved to... Silver somethin'. Shoals, Seas, Surfer, whatever. When you find her, give her this.
:[thud]
:'''Meathead Pony''': It's been stackin' up for years! And tell her to ''change her address!''
:[door slams]

:[montage music]
:[knocking]

:[squeaking]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Silver Stable Community: For the best golden years." This has to be it!
:'''Spike''': I hope so. It's the last "Silver" spot on the map we haven't looked.
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': [straining] [gasps] Whoa! This place is—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Terrible, I know! There's not a single bookshelf in sight!
:'''Sand Trap''': [snoring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Poor Dusty... [to receptionist] Excuse me!
:'''"Teddie Safari"''': Yes, how may I help you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do you have a resident named Dusty Pages?
:'''"Teddie Safari"''': Oh, yes. Her apartment is in the next complex, ground floor.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe that ''my'' carelessness sent her ''here'', when she could be happily surrounded by millions of wonderful-smelling books!
:'''Spike''': You realize that might just be a you thing, right?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] There she is! Here we go. [exhales]
:[knocking]
:[long pause]
:[watch ticking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Spike''': She's bound to be back soon. Maybe we should just wait here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. We are fixing this ''now''. This place isn't that big. We can find her.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry to interrupt your ''plein air'' painting, but we're looking for Dusty Pages. Have you seen her?
:'''Apple Rose''': Sure have!
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] And...?
:'''Apple Rose''': She had to leave early to get to her ''fengbi de ti'' session.
:'''Old Stallion''': Which is right before she leads the woodworking class with me. Then she's on to windsurfing.
:'''Apple Rose''': Ooh, and don't forget theatre rehearsal! Dusty's playing the lead role. Again.
:'''Old Stallion''': Then there's her band practice later.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you!
:'''Spike''': Wow. Dusty sounds like one busy pony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, she's just filling her days with distractions to cover the pain of losing the best job ever! But not for long!

:[montage music]
:[gate swinging]

:[teleportation zap]
:[hammer tapping]
:[door shuts and opens]

:[splash]
:[more splashes]

:[door opens]

:[door opens]
:[band playing music]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Dusty Pages, finally! Come on, Spike!
:'''Spike''': Wait. She looks pretty happy up there.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Trust me, it's all an act. She'll be a lot happier when I deliver the news that she can go back to working at the library!
:[music abruptly stops]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Care to take five, everypony?
:'''Dusty Pages''': Ah! Twilight Sparkle?! My stars! It's so wonderful to see you! What are you doing here?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've been looking all over Equestria for you!
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I need to tell you something.
:'''Dusty Pages''': Well, you brought my mail! Oh, thank you! [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. I mean, yes, we did, but that's not why we're here. I let you down, and I can't forgive myself until I set things right.
:'''Dusty Pages''': I don't remember you doing anything wrong.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You told me to take care of a special book I checked out from the Canterlot Library, and I never brought it back!
:'''Dusty Pages''': [gasps] It was ''you'' that had that book out? The one that broke my perfect record?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But now you can bring it to Canterlot Library and get your job back!
:'''Dusty Pages''': No, thank you! I don't ever need to see that library again! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be.

:[band playing music]
:'''Spike''': [snapping fingers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do you mind?
:[music pauses, continues softly]
:'''Spike''': [slurping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't understand. If Dusty Pages won't go back to Canterlot Library and explain everything, then she won't be able to get her job back. Even worse, her record will remain imperfect!
:'''Spike''': And yours will, too?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, yeah! But that doesn't matter any more!
:'''Spike''': [dryly] Really?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, maybe a little bit. Oh, no, bits! The late fines! How much do I owe now?!
:[abacus clicking]
:'''Spike''': Uhhh... you don't wanna know.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] It would've been worth all the bits in Equestria if I had made things right with Dusty! I wish I knew why she won't go back!
:'''Spike''': Why don't you ask her?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': She didn't seem to want to talk.
:'''Spike''': You surprised her, and she probably had something else on her schedule. That thing is packed! Come on. What have you got to lose?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now that I've messed up this much? Nothing. You're right, Spike. It's worth a try. Where do you think she went? Crochet? Bingo?

:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A squishy fruit food-fight tournament?!
:[splats]
:'''Spike''': Hey, everypony! We come in—
:[splat]
:'''Spike''': Eh, pieces.
:[splats]
:[teleportation zap]
:[splats]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Stop! We just want to talk to Dusty Pages for a moment! Please?
:'''Dusty Pages''': ''Time out!'' [to Twilight] Next time, you should rent gear.
:'''Spike''': We're not actually here for the game.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I was hoping you'd give me another chance to talk to you about the library book.
:'''Dusty Pages''': [sighs] This really means a lot to you, doesn't it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-hmm. I know I ruined your life by not returning my book on time, and I will do anything I can to make it up to you. Even promise to never take a book out of a library again, if that's what it takes.
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Dusty Pages''': [laughs]
:'''Spike''': That is not the reaction we expected.
:'''Dusty Pages''': Twilight, dear, you've got it all backwards! I'm not upset with you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're not?
:'''Dusty Pages''': No! If I'm mad at anypony, it's me.
:[tapping]
:'''Dusty Pages''': All those years I spent hiding away in that library, trying to be perfect. When your book never came in, I felt something exhilarating!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What was it?
:'''Dusty Pages''': Freedom.
:'''Spike''': From books?
:'''Dusty Pages''': From perfection! I was too stubborn to know when to call it quits! It took your mistake to make me realize that I wasn't living the life I wanted!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You mean you weren't fired? You left the library because you ''wanted'' to?
:'''Dusty Pages''': Twilight, your late book was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now I'm not afraid to try things I might fail at. In fact, sometimes messing up teaches me more than getting it right!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're sure you don't want to return it and get that perfect record back?
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [strangled scream]
:'''Dusty Pages''': Ah, good. It was a yellow one. You can still see the words.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But it'll have a stain!
:'''Dusty Pages''': That doesn't change the truth inside it. Wait. Did you even read that thing?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, uh, no, I guess I didn't.
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Perfection".
:'''Dusty Pages''': And the next part?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "The Impossible Pursuit".
:'''Spike''' and '''Dusty Pages''': [laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. That might've been useful to look at earlier.

:'''First Folio''': Uh-huh... Your total late fees come to...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': However much it is, I'll cover it. Uh, do you have a monthly payment plan?
:'''First Folio''': Twenty-eight bits.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': [gasps]
:'''Spike''': That's ''it''?!
:'''First Folio''': Yah-huh. Most ponies don't know that it caps at a month. Probably 'cause we don't tell them. [snorts]
:[bits clinking]
:'''First Folio''': Thank you. Your account is back to normal. Although we will be taking down your Best Book Borrower picture.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um, is that ''really'' necessary? Heh. It just seems so permanent. Heh. I mean, I did return the book, after all.
:'''Spike''': [clears throat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. Letting the perfection go. [sighs] You want me to reshelve this for you?
:'''First Folio''': No, it's an old edition. We've already replaced it with a new copy.
:'''Spike''': In that case, can we keep it? It might be a good reminder to have around.
:'''First Folio''': You sure? It's got a stain.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's what makes it perfect.

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:'''Announcer''': Highlights in the world of sports! Buckball fever has swept Equestria! What started as a backyard hobby for fruit farmers and the like has blossomed into a literal phenomenon, with something for everypony. Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies alike can't get enough of this breakthrough sport.
:[fans cheering]
:'''Announcer''': And with its popularity still on the rise, buckball fans want—nay, ''demand''—an institution catering to their new obsession. And the ponies of Appleloosa answered the call, delivering a state-of-the-art locale where fans Equestria over can celebrate their passion: the Buckball Hall of Fame. Though given the game's recent nature, the only inductees so far will be the members of the current championship team from Ponyville.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whispering loudly] Do you think they know we're here?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I think they have a pretty good idea.
:'''Snails''': A pretty good idea about what? [chomps]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Fluttershy''': I can't believe the ponies of Appleloosa built this place.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, especially after their team lost to us. They must ''really'' love buckball.
:'''Fan''': [chuckles] Oh, my gosh! It's you! I can't believe you're you! I mean, here! I mean, Team Ponyville! Yeah!
:'''Snails''': Yep, it's us.
:'''Fan''': How much for an autograph?
:'''Snips''': Bits for autographs, eh?
:[cha-ching!]
:'''Snips''': [whispering] Snails, you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
:'''Snails''': What is the sound of one hoof clapping?
:'''Snips''': Yeah! I mean, uh, no! How many of you would pay for an autograph from my best friend Snails?
:[ponies clamoring]
:'''Male Pony''': I can't believe I'm about to get his autograph.
:'''Snails''': Wow! That's a lot of writing.
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm so proud they decided to honor us. I never thought I'd get to be in anything like a Hall of Fame.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Me, neither! Unless you count a Royal Order of Party Planners Memorial Library, which I don't, because every party planner gets one of those eventually.
:[hooves clack]
:[clamoring continues]
:[bits jingling]
:'''Fluttershy''': I hope Snails finishes signing autographs soon. We can't play without him. And if we lose or forfeit one game, we'll be out of the tournament.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, he better get his flank over here then! You have to win the first few games without me cheering you on.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, why?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] Applejack was too busy to come, so she made me promise to go to ''all'' the museum exhibits and tell her about them. I'm gonna try to get in first and beat the crowd so I can get back to the tournament faster.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! Then you'd better hurry. Looks like there's already a line.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?! [grunts] The doors aren't even open yet! What kind of sports fan camps out for a museum?
:'''Quibble Pants''': The real question is what kind of sports fan ''doesn't''?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] Quibble Pants?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Rainbow Dash, fancy meeting ''you'' here.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fancy meeting ''me''? I'm a sportspony. Of course ''I'd'' be here. What's fancy is ''you'' being here. If "fancy" meant confusing.
:'''Quibble Pants''': There's nothing fancy ''or'' confusing about it. Y-You can't keep me away from that... that buckball rink. I'm... I'm the biggest fan there is.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, it's a buckball ''field''. And you ''are''?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Oh... sure. What w-with all th-the ''bucking'' and the ''balling'', uh, uh, on the buckball field, w-which is where they play buckball. I-I-I wanted to be first inside to experience the grand history of the sport. I-I mean, I guess only a real fan would understand that.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whaaaa...?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Oh, perfect timing. Rainbow Dash, I'd like you to meet Clear Sky, the most amazing pony I've ever met.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um, you've met Daring Do, so that's probably an exaggeration. [to Clear Sky] No offense.
:'''Clear Sky''': None taken. When it comes to describing your special somepony, a little exaggeration's normal. [to Quibble] And I feel the same way about you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And who is this?
:'''Clear Sky''': This is my daughter Wind Sprint.
:'''Quibble Pants''': And she is pretty amazing, too!
:'''Clear Sky''': Wind, did you thank Quibble for camping out so we'd be first in line?
:'''Wind Sprint''': [unenthusiastic] Thanks.
:'''Quibble Pants''': No problem. I-I-I probably would have done it anyway. I mean, I... I can't wait to see the... [reading from a brochure] "evolution of the buck basket from farm to field"! That... That sounds just, I mean, oh, wow! There... There is a lot to see!
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Wind Sprint''': I'd rather see the game.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Oh. Well, I... I mean, sure. T-T-That makes sense. We could just go to the tournament instead.
:'''Clear Sky''': No! Quibble planned this whole thing for us, and you could be a little more appreciative!
:[door opens]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles] I kind of wanted to skip the museum, too. ''But'' I promised a friend that I'd check out all the exhibits.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Ugh! ''All'' of them?
:'''Quibble Pants''': You, know, I-I'd like a chance to catch up with Rainbow Dash. Why don't we split up? We'll... We'll cover more ground that way, and...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''So''... you and Clear Sky, huh?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Oh, yeah, she's great. Honestly, I've never been happier... [panicked] Which is why I need your help! I don't know what any of this stuff is!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What do you mean?
:'''Quibble Pants''': See this? I-I don't know what it is.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': A ball?
:'''Quibble Pants''': W— And this? I-I— No idea!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's a basket. How do you not know what these are?
:'''Quibble Pants''': I'm not even a hundred percent sure what ''bucking'' is. I literally know nothing about buckball or any other sport!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, I figured you weren't the sportiest pony in Equestria.
:'''Quibble Pants''': But Wind Sprint ''is'', and her dad was some big athlete, too. I-I can't compete with that. I really want things with Clear Sky to work out, but if Wind doesn't like me, I-I might as well give up.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, why?
:'''Quibble Pants''': They're a family. Even if it's okay with Clear Sky, I wouldn't ask them to make me a part of it if Wind Sprint isn't on board. I thought if I could convince Wind I was a big buckball fan, we'd have something to bond over, but I'm... I'm pretty sure she's on to me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Here.
:'''Quibble Pants''': [grunting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Give it a shot. It's easy.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Aah! Aah! Oof!
:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, I don't think she's fooled.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Could... Could ''you'' talk to her? I-I mean, you're a famous sportspony. Y-You'd know what to say. Maybe you could talk me up a little.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ha! No problem. I've totally got your flank.
:'''Quibble Pants''': [grunts]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [to Wind Sprint] Trust me, the game's a ''lot'' harder to play with apples.
:'''Wind Sprint''': You play?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who do you think taught them? Of course, being a Wonderbolt takes up most of my time, so I don't get to practice as much as I'd like.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Wait. You're Rainbow Dash? The Wonderbolt? Whoa, my dad was a great flyer, too.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hmm, you don't say. You know, Quibble's pretty sporty, too.
:'''Clear Sky''': [groans]
:'''Quibble Pants''': [grunts]
:[thud]
:'''Wind Sprint''': [unconvinced] If you say so.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I think I've seen enough of this museum for ''three'' Applejacks. Let's go watch some buckball!
:'''Quibble Pants''': That sounds awesome! Oh, but first, I got you [singsongy] a little surprise.
:'''Wind Sprint''': [unimpressed] Oh. A book.
:[thud]
:'''Quibble Pants''': Oh, not just a book. It's a buckball almanac. This thing has every buckball fact and statistic ever recorded!
:'''Wind Sprint''': [sarcastic] Wow.
:'''Quibble Pants''': I know! I never realized there was so much math in buckball. I-I mean, this game's got more numbers than ''Ogres & Oubliettes''. [laughs, snorts]
:'''Wind Sprint''': Thanks?
:'''Quibble Pants''': I-I-I guess I could hold it for you. You know, so you don't have to carry it.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Can we go to the game now?
:'''Clear Sky''': Sure, honey. Listen, Q, this trip was a lovely idea, and the book was sweet, but you don't have to try so hard. Everything's gonna be fine. [kisses]
:'''Quibble Pants''': Not even my presents are in the ball court.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, do you mean "ball park"?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Do I?! I don't know! One thing's for sure: Wind is never gonna like a pony like me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Of course she will. She just needs to see your sporty side.
:'''Quibble Pants''': I don't ''have'' a sporty side.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''Every''pony has a sporty side, and we're gonna find yours. By the end of the day, I am gonna turn you into the sportiest pony in Equestria!

:'''Quibble Pants''': Look, I'm not saying it's a terrible idea, but it's a terrible idea! You can't turn ''me'' into an athlete! It's impossible!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's either that or be yourself and bond with Wind over comic books and role-playing games.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Ooh! Ah! [laughs]
:'''Quibble Pants''': Uh, I have a 17 charisma, all right? Don't you think I tried? She doesn't even like ''Daring Do''. She thinks she's not athletic enough.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?! Wow. We need to get started on "Operation: Sportify" ASAP.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': To figure out what your sporty side is, we just need to see what your skills are. Everypony's got something. Speed!
:[zooming]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Strength!
:'''Quibble Pants''': Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Agility! Heh. Of course, some ponies can do it all.
:'''Quibble Pants''': You're amazing, but what about me?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Right. We should probably start small. I'll pass the ball to you, and you just pass it back to me, okay?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Okay. Uh-huh.
:[music builds up]
:'''Quibble Pants''': And... buckball!
:[thud]
:'''Quibble Pants''': Ow.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay. Maybe agility's not your thing.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ready?
:'''Quibble Pants''': If I say no, do I still have to run?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yep.
:'''Snips''': Can we get on with this? Snails and I did so well with the autographs, we decided to expand. And these souvenirs are not going to sell themselves!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Remember, think speed.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Got it.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': On your marks, get set...
:'''Quibble Pants''': Speed. ''Speed.''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Go! [blows whistle]
:'''Quibble Pants''': Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Whew! [laughs] Okay! What a race, right? Oh. So much for speed.
:'''Snips''': Eh, this was fun, but I've gotta get back to work.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Quibble. You got this!
:'''Quibble Pants''': [strained voice] I... got... this! I... Ugh! This is hopeless. I... I don't have any skills. Not agility, not speed. I-I can't even lift more than one book, and I love books!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': If we had time to train, I know I could mold you into the perfect sportspony. [groans] Or at least a ''sportier'' pony.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Who knows how long that would take? I-I need to get Wind to like me ''now''.
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Maybe you're not the best athlete in Equestria, or the most coordinated, or the fastest, or... even a little bit strong.
:'''Quibble Pants''': I-I'm sorry, wait. Is this supposed to be making me feel better? Because it's not.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''But'' none of that matters because I just figured out how to sportify you!

:[action theme]
:[whistle blows]
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Game Announcer''': And with that score, the stars of Team Ponyville advance to the next round. If they keep winning like this, they'll never get off the field.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Wow! The players from Ponyville are so good!
:'''Quibble Pants''': They sure are.
:'''Clear Sky''': Quibble, where have you been? I was hoping we'd all watch the tournament together.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Oh, I've just been arranging for us to hang out with a few of my close friends. From Team Ponyville. That is, if Wind's up for it.

:'''Clear Sky''': This is wonderful, Q, but I still feel like you're trying too hard to get Wind's approval.
:'''Wind Sprint''': This is so great! Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are the best players out there!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, you can thank Quibble. Wonderbolts, buckball stars... He's friends with the sportiest ponies around, so he must be pretty sporty, too, right?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh, so ''this'' is Quibble Pants. Rainbow Dash told us all about how you two spent a whole Daring Do convention geeking out together about books!
:'''Fluttershy''': And even though at first she thought you were the most annoying fanpony she ever met, you two eventually became friends.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Uh...
:'''Clear Sky''': I guess even sportsponies agree. Quibble's a pony you like more and more over time.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Ugh. Knowing sportsponies isn't the same as being one. [to Fluttershy and Pinkie] What's it like playing in front of all those fans?
:'''Fluttershy''': Um...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I guess you'll find out.
:'''Wind Sprint''': What do you mean?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Yes, what ''do'' you mean?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I think it's time we told Wind about your next surprise.
:'''Clear Sky''': Q, Wind really doesn't need any more surprises.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Is it another book?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': A – books are awesome. And B – this is way more awesomer than that! For the tournament halftime show, you and Quibble are gonna play a game of buckball against Team Ponyville!
:'''Quibble Pants''': We're ''what?!''

:[distant crowd cheering]
:[whoosh, thud]
:[whirring, thuds]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, you should probably stretch.
:'''Quibble Pants''': No amount of stretching is gonna make this okay! What were you thinking?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Look, you wanted to impress Wind Sprint, and this just made sense.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Really? How does me making a fool of myself in front of her, Sky, and a billion buckball fans make sense?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't worry, I've got your flank. I already talked to Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy. They're ''totally'' gonna make you look good.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Oh. Okay, well, maybe this isn't the absolute worst idea ever.
:'''Game Announcer''': Mares and stallions, foals and colts! Put your hooves together for today's halftime presentation, as buckball's biggest stars take on a team of fans just like you!
:[crowd cheering]

:'''Referee''': [blows whistle]
:[whoosh]
:[thud]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Game Announcer''': And that's one for the Ponyville champs! Looks like these fans don't know what they signed up for!

:'''Referee''': [blows whistle]
:[whooshing]
:'''Fluttershy''': [flatly] Oh, no. Quibble's wide open, and I'll never get there in time to block.
:[whoosh]
:[slow motion noise]
:[crowd awwws]
:'''Game Announcer''': Ooh! Looks like our fan team needs to work on their passing!

:'''Referee''': [blows whistle]
:[whooshing]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hee-hee!
:[crack]
:[smack]
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:'''Game Announcer''': And the fan team finally scores! ...For the other side. That makes three! Team Ponyville wins!
:[smack]

:[thud]
:'''Quibble Pants''': It says very clearly on page six-forty-seven of the expanded buckball tournament rules that "a goal is scored when an Earth pony sends the ball into a basket". But it doesn't say ''which'' basket!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, I'm pretty sure everypony knows you're not supposed to score in the other team's goal.
:'''Quibble Pants''': But the rules don't say that! If that goal is ours, it's only two-to-one, and we can keep playing.
:'''Wind Sprint''': I don't ''want'' to! You're ''not'' a sportspony! It's ''not'' fun playing this game with you!
:'''Quibble Pants''': I was just... trying to get her to like me.
:'''Clear Sky''': I know! But I told you you didn't need to. You and I have to rethink all of this.
:'''Quibble Pants''': [whimpers, sighs]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': What are you doing out here?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Apparently this book is as close to sports as I'll ever get.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on. That goal you scored for the other team was amazing.
:'''Quibble Pants''': [sighs] Thanks for trying, Rainbow Dash, but I think we can both agree the whole sportify idea was a big flop.
:[thump]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?! We haven't even gotten started! I've got, like, seven more top-notch ideas to turn you into a super-sporty pony!
:'''Quibble Pants''': [sighs] Wind's already made up her mind, and so have I. Time to throw up the towel.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's "throw ''in'' the towel". And that's ridiculous! You can't just give up!
:'''Quibble Pants''': Wind and Sky deserve a pony they both like in their lives. Besides, Sky wants to "rethink things", so I'm just beating her to the lunch.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's "beating her to the ''punch''", and it's barely a sports reference. How do you not know that?
:'''Quibble Pants''': Because... I! Don't! Know! ''Anything''! About! Sports! And pretending I did just made things worse.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So you should stop pretending! Look, you are ''terrible'' at sports. You're uncoordinated, slow, weak—
:'''Quibble Pants''': Okay, again, not really making me feel better.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And you're completely clueless about anything having to do with athletics. But maybe ''I'm'' not the pony you should've come to for help.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Oh.

:'''Wind Sprint''': I wish we didn't even come here.
:'''Clear Sky''': Quibble thought you'd like it.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Well, I don't, and I don't like him. Why do ''you'' like him?
:'''Clear Sky''': Because he's kind, and smart, and his friends certainly seem to care about him, which is always a good sign.
:'''Wind Sprint''': I don't care how many ponies care about him. They're not gonna make me forget about Dad.
:'''Clear Sky''': Oh, sweetheart. I know Quibble's trying too hard, but he doesn't want you to stop loving your dad. He just wants you to like him. And I think maybe there's enough room in your heart to do both.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Hey, there. Glad I found you, because I have a confession to make. I know it's hard to imagine, but I'm... really not all that sporty.
:'''Clear Sky''': [mock horror] [gasps] No!
:'''Quibble Pants''': I'm sorry I was trying so hard to convince you otherwise. I just really wanted us to get along, but I guess it backfired. Do you think we could start over? Maybe we could watch some of the tournament together, and you could teach me some sports stuff?

:[whoosh, thud]
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Wind Sprint''': Okay. That's their ball.
:'''Quibble Pants''': I'll try to remember that if I ever decide to play buckball again. But I probably won't. Oh, look. Pinkie Pie's gonna flip and triple bounce the ball into the goal.
:[springing]
:[thud]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Wind Sprint''': How did you know that?
:'''Quibble Pants''': It's right here. Pinkie flips and triple-bounce bucks over eighty percent of her shots from the northwest section of the field when the wind is blowing from the east.
:'''Wind Sprint''': Huh. I guess this book's kind of cool after all.
:'''Clear Sky''': [slurping]
:'''Quibble Pants''': Look, Sky, I know you're thinking of calling it quits between us, and after today, I don't blame you. But Wind and I just made a connection!
:'''Clear Sky''': Calling it quits? What are you talking about?
:'''Quibble Pants''': You said you wanted to rethink things.
:'''Clear Sky''': Yeah! Things like having your friend help you ''pretend'' to be a sportspony so Wind would like you.
:'''Quibble Pants''': Wha— I-I don't— I— Oh! I-I didn't... What?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Say wha—? [nervous laugh] Wha...?! Hah! Nah!
:'''Wind Sprint''': Mom, look what Quibble showed me! [reading] "When Fluttershy flies higher than the other Pegasus, Pinkie scores ninety-two percent of the time," and it just happened!
:'''Clear Sky''': Wow! You better watch out, or you're gonna start to like books.
:'''Wind Sprint''': I guess that wouldn't be so bad.
:'''Clear Sky''': Huh. Looks like you didn't need sportiness, famous ponies, or lavish gifts to bond with Wind after all.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Technically, he still needed to buy her the book, but that's it.
:'''Quibble Pants''', '''Clear Sky''', and '''Wind Sprint''': [laughing]

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:'''Silverstream''': [gasps] See?! New posters! We never had ''those'' underwater!
:'''Young Six''': [excited chattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I won't keep you in suspense any longer. We're bringing one of Ponyville's oldest traditions to our school – the Fetlock Fete.
:'''Smolder''': The what-lock what?
:'''Sandbar''': It's a pony dance party! They're the best!
:'''Ocellus''': I'm ready!
:[transformation noise]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggles] You don't need to do that, Ocellus. This year, the event's at school and open to everycreature. We're calling our dance the Amity Ball.
:'''Ocellus''': Even better!
:[transformation noise]
:'''Yona''': Yona not know Amity Ball dance. Yona only know traditional dance of Yakyakistan. Go like this! [grunting]
:[loud thumping]
:'''Yona''': Ball dance like that?
:[thud]
:'''Sandbar''': [laughs] Not exactly. It isn't just ''one'' dance. It's a whole night of them. Plus an awesome party!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And we'll have all the old Fetlock Fete traditions – the Pony Pal Contest, the lucky pot dinner. You'll love it! So, like this says, "get your pony pal and come along."
:'''Smolder''': Want to go? I've got nothing better to do.
:'''Gallus''': You had me at "dinner".
:'''Silverstream''': [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now, who wants to help me hang more posters?
:'''Silverstream''': Me!
:'''Ocellus''': Sure!
:'''Sandbar''': Hey, Yona, want to be my pony pal? We can enter the contest together.
:'''Yona''': But Yona yak. Yona not pony.
:'''Sandbar''': So?
:'''Yona''': Pony, pony, more pony.
:'''Sandbar''': Aw, that's just a poster. Come on! It'll be tons of fun together. Promise.
:'''Yona''': Okay. Yona go with Sandbar.
:'''Sandbar''': Great! I'll get the tickets. See you later! [laughs]
:'''Yona''': Yona not let Sandbar down! Yak best at being pony pal! But Yona not sure how if she not pony.
:[crash]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! Oh, terribly sorry, Yona. All these dresses I'm sewing for the dance have me completely frazzled.
:'''Yona''': Dress? Yona need dress for dance?! Yona have lots to learn about being best pony pal.

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[sewing machine whirring]
:[knocking]
:'''Rarity''': [yelps]
:[door opens]
:'''Yona''': Yona interrupting?
:'''Rarity''': Oh. [laughs] Well, not interrupting exactly. More like blocking the flow— uh, stopping me from what I'm doing— so, yes, interrupting! [nervous laugh] Now, what can I do for you, Yona?
:'''Yona''': Yona not know yak need special pony dress for dance. Yona no can wear what Yona always wear?
:'''Rarity''': Yona could— I mean, you could. But the Fetlock Fete or whatever Twilight is calling it – it's all about a tradition. There's a certain way to do everything at the dance.
:'''Yona''': Yes! That what Yona want to learn! How to do all the pony things, even if Yona has to wear dress.
:'''Rarity''': Well, uh, y-y-yes, if that's what you really want.
:'''Yona''': Mm-hmm! Yona be best pony pal for Sandbar!
:'''Rarity''': In that case, at an elegant affair like a pony dance, one must converse in a sophisticated fashion. Talking with Brussels sprouts in your mouth helps you to learn to [elocuting] ar-ti-cu-late. [normally] Take a mouthful, and repeat after me.
:'''Yona''': [chomps]
:'''Rarity''': [elocuting] How kind of you to ask me to tea.
:'''Yona''': [muffled] How kind of you to ask me to tea.
:'''Rarity''': [elocuting] May I offer you a glass of punch?
:'''Yona''': [muffled] May I offer you a glass of punch?
:'''Rarity''': [elocuting] The weather is quite agreeable today.
:'''Yona''': [muffled] The weather is quite agreeable today. [chews, gulps, belches loudly] Yona ''like'' Brussels sprouts!
:'''Rarity''': Let's move on.

:'''Rarity''': We will need to do something about your hairstyle. But first, let's find the right dress!
:[wheels squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': Now, purple taffeta, frosted chiffon... [gasps] Gold brocade! One of my favorites!
:'''Yona''': Yona like brown.
:'''Rarity''': Blech... Earth tones. They're so... [laughs nervously] ...earthy, aren't they? Don't worry. We shall find something to make you stand out.
:'''Yona''': Yona not want to stand out. Yona want to fit in.
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Quite. And by the time we're through, it'll be like you've been going to pony dances your whole life.
{{#lst:Fit Right In|song}}
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] I almost forgot! The most important part of the ball!
:'''Yona''': Oh. [scoffs, laughs] Yona already have pony pal.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, not that, darling. The dancing! And I know precisely who can help!

:'''Yona''': Uh... Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy good at dancing?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't be so surprised. I'm awesome at everything! Except for baking.
:'''Fluttershy''': There are two traditional dances that everypony does at the Fete. After a few days of practicing with us, you'll know them both.
:'''Yona''': And fit right in!
:'''Rarity''': Absolutely. We'll start with the slow dance, the Pony Cotillion. That's Fluttershy's specialty.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, [nervous laugh], I wouldn't say specialty. It's just fun. Here, Yona. I made you a chart.
:[paper unfurling]
:'''Fluttershy''': All you have to do is follow these dance steps. You'll learn them in no time.
:[thump]
:[record needle scratches]
:[classical music plays]
:'''Fluttershy''': Now, just start walking. Step on whatever color I name. Let's begin. Blue, red, step ahead. Green, black, now step back. Now you try.
:'''Yona''': Blue, red, step— ah, oh! No. Um, Yona start over. Blue, red, green, black, yak step back?
:'''Fluttershy''': Good! Now, black, green, red, and blue. Red, black, hold one and two. Red, blue, red once more. Green, black, blue, red, three and four.
:'''Yona''': [yelps] Yona feel like she has four front feet! [yelps]
:[thud]
:[squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh. Um, maybe we should try this again later.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't worry, Yona.
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That was the hard one. Mine's ''way'' easier.
:[needle scratches]
:[uptempo pop music plays]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': A little dance called the Pony Prance! The key to this one is speed!
:[whooshing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Yona, try it! Just get with the flow and let yourself go!
:[loud thumping]
:[crashing]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, my!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa there!
:'''Yona''': [panting] ''Yona like to flow and go!''
:[thump]

:'''Applejack''': Welcome to Sweet Apple Acres, Yona. Rarity tells us you need some help gettin' ready for the big dance.
:'''Rarity''': "Some". Ha! Indeed. And we only have a few more days.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, you've come to the right place. Because if you asked me what my favorite part of the dance is, I'd say everything about the dance! But especially... this! The Fetlock lucky pot dinner!
:'''Applejack''': It's part of the Ponyville dance tradition. Everypony brings a dish to share, and we swap 'em without knowin' whose is whose. Although my lucky pot probably gives me away. [laughs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You can cook anything you want! Like, can I suggest, oh, I don't know, maybe... ''cupcakes''?!
:'''Rarity''': Uh, I already told Yona a little bit about that tradition. She's even brought her own lucky... bucket.
:'''Yona''': Yak buckets are best buckets. Yona think make traditional yak dish – tree-root stew!
:[flies buzzing]
:'''Yona''': Extra fiber. Mmmm. Ponies like?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm, I'm not sure. So, just in case, let's get baking!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [quickly] Flour, milk, sugar, butter, icing. Then we mix, and we beat, and we pour into pans. We bake...
:[ding!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And now you try it!
:[ripping]
:'''Yona''': [sneezes]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, that's one way to mix it.
:'''Applejack''': Let's try somethin' a little simpler. I'm sure we can do somethin' with these.
:'''Yona''': Yah!
:[splat]
:'''Applejack''': O-kay. Applesauce it is.
:[thwack]

:[montage music]
:'''Yona''': Blue, red, green... whoa! Blue...

:[tumbling]
:[splatting]

:[ripping]

:[whiffle-whiffle-whiffle]
:[ding!]

:'''Yona''': [muffled] How kind of you to ask me to tea.

:[scrubbing]

:[boinging]

:'''Yona''': [chomp] [less muffled] How kind of you to ask me to tea.

:'''Mane Six except Twilight Sparkle''': [snoring]
:'''Yona''': [rhythmically] Blue, red, step ahead. [elocuting] How kind of you... [rhythmically] Green, black, Yona step back. [elocuting] ...to ask Yona to tea. [rhythmically] Black, green, red, and blue. Red, black hold one and two. Red, blue, red once more. Green, black, blue, red, three and four!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Look! She's dancing!
:'''Applejack''': How 'bout that? And she's good!
:'''Rarity''': Yona, if someone at the party tells you they're thirsty, you say...
:'''Yona''': [elocuting] May Yona— um... May ''I'' offer you a cup of punch?
:'''Rarity''': By Celestia, I think she's got it!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': She's ''really'' got it!
:'''Applejack''': Yona, you did it!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You dance great!
:'''Fluttershy''': And are ''so'' well spoken!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You'll be the hit of the ball!
{{#lst:Fit Right In|reprise}}

:'''Spike''': [amplified] Hello, everycreature! I'm your DJ, Scales-n-Tail, spinning your favorite tunes all night long! So welcome to the Fetlock Fet— I mean, the Amity Ball!
:[students cheering]
:'''Gallus''': I'm just glad I'm here with you guys. Least I'm not the only non-pony in the crowd.
:'''Sandbar''': You're not still worried about that, are you? Like Headmare Twilight said, this is a dance for everycreature. There's no pony pressure.
:'''Gallus''', '''Ocellus''', and '''Smolder''': [giggling]
:'''Ocellus''': You should've told Yona that.
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, what do you mean?
:'''Silverstream''': Didn't you hear? Our teachers have been helping her get ready for the dance! She's been taking ''lessons''. [crunching]
:'''Smolder''': She's gone full pony for the dance.
:'''Gallus''': All for you.
:[snap!]
:'''Sandbar''': For me? Why?
:'''Yona''': [elocuting] How kind of you to ask me to this soiree, Sandbar.
:'''Gallus''', '''Ocellus''', '''Silverstream''', and '''Smolder''': Uhh...
:'''Smolder''': What?
:'''Silverstream''': You look so ''weird''!
:'''Sandbar''': Yona?!
:'''Yona''': [elocuting] Quite. Oh, I do hope I make a good pony pal for you.
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, of course you do. But, Yona, you didn't need to do any of... this.
:'''Smolder''': And why are you talking so funny?
:'''Yona''': [elocuting] I am not "talking funny". I'm fitting in.
:'''Gallus''': Could've fooled me.
:'''Rarity''': Yona! You look absolutely scrumptious, darling. [kissing] Uh, why don't I get that for you?
:'''Sandbar''': You made a lucky pot?
:'''Yona''': [elocuting] Precisely like ponies prepare!
:[microphone feedback]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [amplified] Welcome, everycreature, to our school's first annual Amity Ball! For those of you who've never attended a Fetlock Fete, we can't wait to show you some of our fun traditions on this special night!
:[students cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [amplified] So, Spike...
:'''Spike''': Uh, Scales-n-Tail?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [amplified] Uh, right. Scales-n-Tail. [to crowd] Let's get this party started!
:'''Spike''': [amplified] Oh, yeah, party ponies! It's time to raise the roof and stomp your hoof for the traditional first dance of the night, the Pony Cotillion!
:[classical music plays]
:'''Yona''': Ah! Yona know this one!
:'''Sandbar''': You do?
:'''Yona''': [elocuting] Indeed! Green, black, then step back. Shall we?
:[spoon clinks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles]
:'''Sandbar''': [chuckles] Wow! How did you learn this?
:'''Yona''': [elocuting] I had good teachers.
:[stretching]
:'''Yona''': Whoa!
:[crash]
:[students gasp]
:[music stops]
:'''Sandbar''': [gasps] Yona! Are you alright?
:'''Yona''': Yona never practice dance with dress on. Uh... [elocuting] I mean, [chuckles] may I offer you a cup of punch?
:[pouring]
:'''Spike''': [amplified] Time to shake things up a little! That's right, everycreature! It's the Pony Prance!
:[slider clicking]
:[uptempo pop music plays]
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, maybe we should sit this one out.
:'''Yona''': [elocuting] No! I do so love the Pony Prance!
:'''Sandbar''': Ah!
:[hooves clicking]
:'''Yona''': [yelps]
:[crunching and crashing]
:[record needle scratches]
:[worried chattering]
:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:'''Yona''': [yelps]
:'''Sandbar''': It's okay, Yona!

:'''Silverstream''': [grunts]
:[smack!]
:'''Smolder''': [grunts]
:[smack!]

:'''Yona''': Wig... come... off! [grunts] Huh? [yelps]
:[skidding brakes]
:[crash!]
:[splat]
:[clang]
:[splats]
:'''Sandbar''': [gasps]
:[splats]
:'''Rarity''': What a calamitous yak-ccident!
:'''Sandbar''': Yona!
:'''Ocellus''': What happened?!
:'''Silverstream''': Are you all right?
:'''Yona''': [bawling] No! Yona ''not'' all right! Yona want to be alone! [crying]
:[flump]

:'''Yona''':
::Yona sad...
::Yona sing sad song...
::Sad Yona...
:[bird twittering]
:'''Yona''': Yona no blame bird. Yona no want to be around Yona either.
::Yona sad...
::Yona sing sad song...
:'''Sandbar''': Yona?
:'''Yona''': [panicked gasp] [sniffling] How Sandbar find Yona?
:'''Sandbar''': I know you pretty well by now. I figured you'd come here. Besides, it's where I'd go if something like that happened to me.
:'''Yona''': Sandbar mean something awful and embarrassing. So awful, Yona cannot come down from treehouse ever!
:[whirring]
:'''Yona''': Will Sandbar bring Yona food and water?
:'''Sandbar''': You know, it really wasn't that bad. I don't think anycreature hardly even noticed.
:[beat]
:'''Sandbar''': Well, maybe one or two didn't. If they happened to be in Canterlot for the day. But anyway, it's all over now, so... will you come back to the dance with me?
:[thump]
:'''Yona''': Yona disappoint Sandbar. Yona not make very good pony.
:'''Sandbar''': Why would you think you disappointed me? And who said anything about having to be a good pony?
:'''Yona''': Yona just want to do all the right pony things and fit in at dance! Then maybe Sandbar and Yona win best pony pals contest. Instead, Yona win worst pony ever.
:[crunch]
:'''Sandbar''': That's not true.
:'''Yona''': Really? Sandbar, name two ponies worse than Yona.
:'''Sandbar''': Cozy Glow and Sombra.
:'''Yona''': [chuckles] Okay, Sandbar right. They worse.
:'''Sandbar''': Yona, it doesn't really matter if you're a great pony or a horrible pony. You're the best ''Yona'' I know. That's why I asked you to the dance.
:'''Yona''': Really?
:'''Sandbar''': I never wanted you to be anything other than what you are. My friend, Yona, the yak. [grunts] So, what do you say? Let's go back to the dance?

:[sweeping]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs]
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Sandbar''': [hushed] Don't worry. I'm with you.
:'''Gallus''': We all are.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yona! Are you all right?
:'''Fluttershy''': We were so worried when you disappeared like that.
:'''Yona''': Yona fine, but... Yona sorry. Not mean to make such a mess and ruin the pony dance.
:'''Applejack''': It's not your fault, sugarcube.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's the opposite. If anything, ''we'' should be apologizing.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I thought we were just teaching you how to have fun at the dance.
:'''Rarity''': We never meant to try to turn you into something you're not.
:'''Yona''': Is okay. Friend help Yona feel better.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And that's why we're giving you this.
:'''Sandbar''' and '''Yona''': Huh?
:'''Sandbar''': No way! The Pony Pal prize!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': From now on, it's the annual Amity Ball Award for Friendship!
:'''Applejack''': No pony-ness required.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We all decided you and Yona totally earned this.
:'''Rarity''': Your actions tonight exemplify the true meaning of friendship.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Congratulations, you two!
:'''Young Six''': [cheering]
:[students cheering]
:'''Spike''': Yona! I'm glad you're back! Everypony wants to learn that crazy dance you did!
:'''Yona''': Yak dance? Is easy! Yona teach... if everycreature want to learn?
:'''Rarity''': It would be an honor.
:'''Spike''': [amplified] You asked for it, and DJ Scales-n-Tail is gonna deliver! Everycreature join Yona for... the Yakyakistan Stomp!

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:'''Cozy Glow''': [clears throat] I don't want to tattle on my good friend Tirek, but... you might like to know he left food out. Again.
:'''Grogar''': I'll deal with it when I'm done.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Don't trust anything that nosy little Pegasus says!
:'''Grogar''': I don't trust anything ''any'' of you say.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Hmph!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Are you planning on attacking anypony anytime soon? If not, I don't know why I'm wasting my time here. I ''am'' a queen, you know?
:'''Grogar''': [snorts] I'm leaving, since it's impossible to accomplish the work I need to do here. I suggest the three of you come to some kind of accord.
:'''Cozy Glow''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [arguing]
:[magic zap]
:'''Cozy Glow''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [muffled]
:'''Grogar''': I don't care how, but you must learn to work together! Only then can we accomplish what you so greatly desire – the defeat of Twilight Sparkle and her friends!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Cozy Glow''': Nothing says "teamwork" like an inspirational banner. When Grogar sees this, he'll realize there's no way he could survive without ''me''!
:'''Lord Tirek''': [grunting]
:'''Cozy Glow''': You're gonna have to exercise a lot to get as big as you were when you absorbed the life force of all those ponies. Anywho, Grogar wants us all to work together, so I've scheduled a team meeting. Doesn't that sound fun? And since Grogar left ''me'' in charge...
:'''Lord Tirek''': No, he didn't.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [giggles] Someone's a real grumpy-taur today. If we aren't meeting, I guess I could just stay and offer positive and inspiring—
:'''Lord Tirek''': Fine! I'll join your meeting. Just leave!
:'''Cozy Glow''': See you soon!

:'''Queen Chrysalis''': It's been weeks, and Grogar's done nothing! It's not healthy to hold on to all of this ''rage''! I could lash out at any moment.
:'''Cozy Glow''': And how are you doing this fine—?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': How do you ''think'' I'm doing?! I'm ready to exact my revenge! [to hunk of wood] See what I mean?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Being cooped up with nothing to do is the worst! You know what you need? A team meeting!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': I don't do meetings.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Grogar left me in charge.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': No, he didn't. And even if he did, Chrysalis obeys no one.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [singsongy] There'll be cupcakes.

:'''Cozy Glow''': Grogar wants us to work together to defeat our enemies. Which means we need to trust each other.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [chewing] If we are to trust one another, perhaps inform Lord Tirek to ''stop trying to absorb my essence!''
:'''Lord Tirek''': [spits] I wasn't doing anything of the sort! How dare you!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': How dare I?! Do you know to whom you are speaking?
:'''Lord Tirek''': How could I not? You tell your log every five minutes.
:'''Cozy Glow''': This is why Grogar left ''me'' in charge.
:'''Lord Tirek''' and '''Queen Chrysalis''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">no! he! didn't!</span>''
:'''Cozy Glow''': [growls] Huh?
{{#lst:Better Way to Be Bad|song}}
:'''Cozy Glow''': Hey! You stepped on my cue!
{|
|
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Well, I did not! ''You'' stepped on ''our'' cue!
|
:'''Lord Tirek''': Ah, your rhythm was ''way'' off!
|
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, you think you're so cool just 'cause you're a queen!
|}
:'''Grogar''': ''Enough!'' I had hoped by now you would've resolved your differences, but apparently not.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Perhaps if we knew what the plan ''was'', we would be better able to prepare!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Assuming you even ''have'' a plan.
:'''Grogar''': Of course I have a plan! I have located an object of power, and it occurs to me this is the perfect test. The three of you will work together to retrieve it. Against this item, those ponies won't stand a chance.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': I have come close to ruling Equestria several times. Perhaps ''I'' should be the one to lead us.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I nearly drained all the magic from Equestria! That was good!
:'''Lord Tirek''': I ''absorbed'' all the magic of Equestria! I could feel it flowing through my body as I grew!
:'''Cozy Glow''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [arguing]
:[magic zap]
:'''Cozy Glow''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [grunt]
:'''Grogar''': Each of you failed to defeat Twilight Sparkle and her friends! My power is greater than all of yours combined. This is but a fraction of it! Understood?!
:'''Cozy Glow''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [various assenting, grunt]
:'''Grogar''': Now ''you'' shall retrieve the rest of it.

:'''Grogar''': [narrating] Thousands of moons ago, the self-righteous Gusty the Great, unable to best me face-to-face, stole my Bewitching Bell. A talisman containing much of my own magic. The Bell cannot be destroyed, so Gusty hid it in a place it has taken me millennia to discover – an enchanted cave high atop Mt. Everhoof, protected by magical winds that prevent anypony from reaching its peak. There, the Bell has remained until now.

:'''Grogar''': Scale Mt. Everhoof. Bring me back my Bell.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [laughs] The ease of this task is laughable.

:[bird screeches]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Well, it ''sounded'' easy.

:[bird screeches]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Scale the mountain...
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': ...retrieve Grogar's Bell...
:'''Cozy Glow''': ...together! I drew up a detailed plan with several visual aids to show how we can... ditch each other and do it alone. Maybe when I'm waiting for them at the top, ''then'' they'll appreciate me.

:[wind whistling]
:[growling]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [hisses]
:[whimpering]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': As if anything on this mountain is scarier than I. [chuckles]

:'''Lord Tirek''': [blows]
:[splat]
:'''Lord Tirek''': [coughs, spits]

:[wind whistling]
:[door opens, closes]
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Halt! Who goes there? A pony? There ain't been ponies around here in I-don't-know-how-many moons!
:'''Cozy Glow''': [whimpering] Oh, golly, good sir. I'm just a poor lost pony looking for help.
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Aw, don't fret, little filly. Ol' Rusty Bucket here, at your service.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I'm so glad I found you. I need help getting to the top of the mountain.
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Uh, no can do, ma'am.
:'''Cozy Glow''': ''Why not?!''
:[rumbling]
:'''Rusty Bucket''': [lowered] Shhh! Not so loud! This here's avalanche territory. I'm the guardian of this here mountain. It's my job to keep ponies from heading up. Nothing at the top but dangerous snow, dangerous ice, and dangerous wind. Basically, it's dangerous.
:'''Cozy Glow''': It must get lonely all by yourself. Maybe I could be your friend?
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Aw. I'd love a friend.
:'''Cozy Glow''': So, now that we are friends, you could help me up the mountain.
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Hmm, uh... a real friend wouldn't ask me to do something I'm not supposed to do. Says so right here in the Journal of Friendship, written by Twilight Sparkle and her friends.
:'''Cozy Glow''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">are. you. kidding me?!</span>'' [echoing]
:[birds chirping]
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Shhhh!
:'''Cozy Glow''': I didn't want to be friends anyway.
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Awww...

:'''Rusty Bucket''': Nope. Not that way neither.

:'''Rusty Bucket''': [yawns]
:[rumbling]
:[flump!]
:[sizzling]
:'''Cozy Glow''': ''I tried being nice!''
:[rumbling]
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Shh-shh-shh! Now, just calm down there, filly.
:'''Cozy Glow''': ''You'' calm down! Ponies are supposed to do [echoing] ''what I ask them to do! It's, like, my thing! Okay?!''
:[rolling]
:[thud]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [screams, fades]
:'''Rusty Bucket''': Meh.
:[door opens, closes]

:[wind whistling]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Apparently I don't need anypony else.
:[transformation noise]
:[clawing noises]
:[whoosh!]
:[thud]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [grunts]
:[transformation noise]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [groans] Agh!

:[leaves rustling]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [panting]
:'''Lord Tirek''': [laughing]
:'''Cozy Glow''': It's not funny, Tirek!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Didn't make it to the top? Surprise, surprise.
:'''Cozy Glow''': You didn't make it to the top either.
:'''Lord Tirek''': I didn't try to.
:'''Cozy Glow''': What?!
:'''Lord Tirek''': It took about five minutes to deduce that Grogar was right. None of us could make it up alone. So, rather than subject myself to the elements, I decided to let you two face the danger, take what you learned, and use it to my advantage. [laughs]
:'''Cozy Glow''': I put up with your "I'm smarter than you" attitude in Tartarus! But I'm over it!
:'''Lord Tirek''': I'd had enough of you trying to manipulate me with that insincere, syrupy sweetness. At least now we can see the real you.
:'''Cozy Glow''': This is not the real me! ''I'm cute and lovable!''
:'''Lord Tirek''': [scoffs] No, you're not. You're annoying, and you snore.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I do not snore!
:'''Lord Tirek''': [mock-snoring]
:'''Cozy Glow''': At least I don't talk to my Gram-Gram in ''my'' sleep.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Don't you dare bring Gram-Gram into this!
:[Ophiotaurus roars]
:'''Cozy Glow''' and '''Lord Tirek''': This is ''your'' fault!

:[Ophiotaurus roars]
:'''{{H:title|as female Ophiotaurus|Queen Chrysalis}}''': [roars]
:[Ophiotaurus grunts softly]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Quick! It's distracted! Let's go!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Wait.
:'''{{H:title|as female Ophiotaurus|Queen Chrysalis}}''': [roars]
:[transformation noise]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [slurps]
:[thud]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Mmmm... So much love. I haven't eaten this well in ages.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [gags] So gross.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Just so we're clear, I didn't save you because I like you. I did it because... because I...
:'''Cozy Glow''': Neeeeeeed us?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [gritted] Yes.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Clearly I was right to wait. Now tell me everything you learned today. Leave nothing out.

:'''Cozy Glow''': Why are you doing that? Didn't you already drain it of love?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': I always save a little for the next day.
:'''Cozy Glow''': You cocoon all of your... meals?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Of course.
:'''Cozy Glow''': So when you pony-napped Twilight and the others, you cocooned them.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Yes. Until that ''sow'' Starlight Glimmer freed them, corrupted my subjects, and stole my hive!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Those ponies have weaknesses. I used that turncoat Discord. Tricked him into helping me capture his so-called "friends".
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [sighs] Discord was really something until friendship ruined him.
:'''Lord Tirek''': You should've seen Twilight's face when her friends appeared in bubbles around me. She was all... [exaggerated groaning]
:'''Cozy Glow''' and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [laughing]
:'''Cozy Glow''': She's so stressed out all the time.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': When I posed as her former foal-sitter, I thought she was going to implode!
:'''Cozy Glow''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [laughing]
:'''Cozy Glow''': I wish I could've seen her face when I nearly erased all the magic from Equestria.
:'''Lord Tirek''': ''All'' magic was a little excessive, don't you think?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Eh, I think big. Besides, it would've been worth it just to see Twilight and her friends bow down to me!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Indeed it would. Who wouldn't love to see those prissy ponies realize they lost everything?
:[transformation noise]
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle with Chrysalis voice|Queen Chrysalis}}''': I'm a pathetic pony princess! I made a detailed list of all the ways I'm a failure!
:'''Cozy Glow''' and '''Lord Tirek''': [laughing]
:'''Lord Tirek''': You know, working with you two may not be the worst thing.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Perhaps... as long as it results in the complete destruction of our enemies.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I wouldn't have it any other way. Do the pathetic princess thing again!
:[transformation noise]
:'''Cozy Glow''' and '''Lord Tirek''': [laughing]

:[door opens, closes]
:[transformation noise]
:'''{{H:title|as female Ophiotaurus|Queen Chrysalis}}''': [roars]

:'''Cozy Glow''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [laughing]

:[zap!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Aah!
:[thud]
:[zap!]
:'''Lord Tirek''': [pained groan]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Can you absorb it and make it go away?
:'''Lord Tirek''': I can only absorb magic from living beings.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Like her?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Betrayal!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Not betrayal. Teamwork. If Tirek absorbs your energy, he might be strong enough to break through.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': And then?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Then... he gives it back.
:'''Lord Tirek''': I do?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': How do I know you won't take my magic and leave me?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Would we do that to you? Okay, normally, yes, we would.
:'''Lord Tirek''': I'll give you your magic back.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Do it.
:[magic sounds]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [groaning]
:'''Lord Tirek''': So... much... power! [kisses] Welcome back, baby!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Lord Tirek''': It's not big enough for me!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Maybe not you! Keep it open, or I'll be trapped forever!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Would that be so terrible?
:'''Lord Tirek''': [chuckles, grunts] Can't... hold... much... longer! ''Hurry!''
:[flump!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Ta-da!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': My magic...
:[magic sounds]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': I-I wasn't sure you were going to give it back.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Neither was I. But working together seemed smarter than to continue fighting.
:'''Cozy Glow''': When we helped each other, it felt better somehow.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': I haven't felt like this since before I lost my hive. Having others who will be there for you is... pleasing.
:'''Lord Tirek''': All of these years taking power from ponies...
:'''Cozy Glow''': When you use your power to help others...
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Yes, it feels... ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">nooooooooo!</span>''
:'''Cozy Glow''' and '''Lord Tirek''': Whoa!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': The Magic of Friendship is like a disease! An infection that spreads to those around you! I watched it infect my hive! I will ''not'' let it get ''me''!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Same.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Obviously.
:'''Cozy Glow''': But... Grogar said we have to work together.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Grogar is too powerful. Something must be done about that. Let Grogar think we're his loyal servants. In the meantime, we'll hatch our own plan.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Ooh... I love a good backstabbing!
:'''Lord Tirek''': After that, we can go back to trying to destroy each other!
:'''Cozy Glow''': In the meantime, what do we do with this?

:'''Grogar''': You failed to retrieve the Bell?!
:[loud thud]
:'''Cozy Glow''': W-W-We're sorry, almighty Grogar.
:'''Lord Tirek''': We worked together as you asked.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': We just aren't as powerful as you.
:'''Grogar''': [angry shout]
:[magic zap]
:[boom!]
:'''Grogar''': Obviously! At least you finally did as you were told and worked together.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Of course!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Whatever you command!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Forget about that old bell. You were right. We're so much more powerful... when we work as a team.

:[knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Smolder''': Uh, Headmare Twilight? Sorry to bug you in the Teachers' Lounge. Is it okay if I miss class?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-hmm. You can make it up tomorrow.
:'''Smolder''': Actually, I'll be gone for a week.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A week?! In the middle of the semester?
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, is everything all right, Smolder?
:'''Smolder''': Not exactly. [sighs] My brother's been having a hard time since I left for school. I want to go home and check on him. He's a really sweet guy, and the other dragons can be kind of rough.
:'''Spike''': Did you say "sweet guy" and "dragon" in the same sentence?
:'''Smolder''': Yeah. He's sort of like you, Spike.
:'''Spike''': Awww...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sorry to hear about your brother, Smolder. But the Dragon Lands are really far for you to go by yourself. And I'm not sure about you missing so much class.
:'''Spike''': Hey! What if she got a school credit for it? Kind of like a... a kindness field trip? I'll go with her.
:'''Smolder''': Thanks! The Dragon Lord is way too busy for personal problems when it's baby dragon hatching season.
:'''Fluttershy''': Baby... dragon... hatching season?! [gasps] All those cute little snouts poking out of those adorable little shells?! Teeny, tiny, twitchy tails?! Can I go too?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, you ''are'' the perfect pony to lead a kindness field trip.
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Fine. But I'm gonna expect a full report when you get back.
:'''Smolder''': How many pages?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I was talking to Fluttershy. Hatching season sounds fascinating!
:'''Fluttershy''', '''Spike''', and '''Smolder''': [laughing]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Spike''': Okay, I made a list of what cheers me up when I'm down, so if your brother's like me, he's gonna love it! What should we do first? The Smile Song? The sharing circle? Or friendship bracelet weaving?
:'''Smolder''': I'm not sure those are the kind of things my brother's gonna be into.
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, what ''would'' make your brother happy?
:'''Smolder''': Just having Spike and me accept him for who he is will make a huge difference. Dragons who appreciate his more sensitive side.
:'''Spike''': I got it! Show tunes!
:'''Smolder''': Yeah, no, but good try.

:'''Fluttershy''': [sniffs] Oh! Uh... [through plugged nose] That's an interesting smell.
:'''Smolder''': [inhales, sighs] The stink of sulfur. Sharp rocks under my claws. [sighs] It's good to be home.
:'''Spike''': I can't wait to meet your brother, Smolder. We're gonna be best buddies. I just know it.
:'''Smolder''': He usually hangs out near here. I'll go try and find him.
:'''Fluttershy''': Spike, do you mind if I take a peek at the cute little baby eggs?
:'''Spike''': No problem. I'll stay here and finish this comfort blanket. It'll be like a hug every time Smolder's brother wraps it around himself.
:'''Fluttershy''': Awww. I'm sure he'll love it, Spike.

:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Oh... my... goodness! Good morning, little one. I've come a long way to meet you. Did you know there's a whole wide world out here waiting to say hello? Did you? Oh, did you, boo? [baby talk]
:'''Ember''': It can't answer you. It's an egg.
:'''Fluttershy''': Ah, Dragon Lord Ember. How nice to see you.
:'''Ember''': Nice to see you too... uh... Which one are you again? The party one? Apple Dash! Or was that the country one?
:'''Fluttershy''': Fluttershy. The one who loves creatures. Are... all these yours?
:'''Ember''': What?! No! None of them are. Watching over eggs is just part of the glamorous life of a Dragon Lord.
:'''Fluttershy''': I think it sounds wonderful.
:'''Ember''': Yeah? Then maybe you can help.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] I'd love to! Just tell me what to do!
:'''Ember''': I don't know. It's my first time being in charge. Dad wasn't big on sharing Dragon Lord details. It's kind of a "burn or be burned" job.
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, I'm sure you're doing great.
:'''Ember''': Not really. The eggs should've hatched by now. But none of them have even cracked.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, dear. Maybe they're lonely? Don't you worry. Auntie Fluttershy's here. And the Dragon Lord and I are gonna do everything we can to welcome you into this world.
:'''Ember''': Really? How?
:'''Fluttershy''': Um... I have no idea.

:'''Spike''': Now, ''that's'' a thing of beauty. Whoa!
:'''Garble''': Well, if it isn't our little pony friend Spike.
:'''Spike''': That's Equestria's official friendship ambassador to the Dragon Lands to you! And I'm not little! I had the molt. See?
:'''Garble''' and '''Dragons''': [laughing]
:'''Garble''': Oh-ho-ho, runt's got wings. I'm soooo impressed. What's that supposed to be?
:'''Spike''': Nothing! Aah! [grunts]
:'''Garble''': Looks like a baby blanket to me.
:'''Spike''': It's not a baby blanket. It's a... comfort blanket.
:'''Garble''' and '''Dragons''': [laughing]
:'''Garble''': Awwww. Did your pony pals make it for you with friendship and gumdrops?
:'''Spike''': No. ''I'' made it. And by the way, knitting's a lot harder than it looks.
:'''Garble''': Check out the baby blanket, guys! It's a lot harder than it looks! [laughs] Got your bwanky!
:'''"Billy"''': Aw, little baby crying?
:'''Spike''': [panting]
:'''Garble''': Oh! Missed!
:'''Spike''': [panting]
:'''"Billy"''': Bet he broke a claw and everything. [laughs]
:'''Clump''': [laughs]
:'''Spike''': Give it back! That's for my friend!
:'''Garble''' and '''Dragons''': [laughing]
:[flames roaring]
:'''Spike''': Cut it out! You know laugh fire's dangerous! It can—!
:[burning sounds]
:'''Spike''': ...do that.
:'''Smolder''': Garble!
:'''Garble''': Smolder? What are you doing here?
:[high-fives]
:'''Clump''': How's it scalin', brah?
:'''Spike''': [whispering] We'd better get out of here before your brother shows up. Garble isn't very nice to sensitive dragons.
:'''Smolder''': But Garble ''is'' my brother.
:'''Spike''': Your brother?!
:'''Garble''': Got a problem with that, pony-boy?
:'''Spike''': Oh, brother. [teeth chattering]

:'''Spike''': [whimpering]
:'''Smolder''': I've missed you, bro. We got a lot of fun to catch up on. There's no lava diving at school.
:'''Clump''': Good luck gettin' Garble to do anything.
:'''"Billy"''': Heh, yeah. He's gotten so weird since you left. Hiding and moping around...
:'''Garble''': I have not!
:'''Clump''', '''"Billy"''', and '''Fume''': Have so!
:'''Smolder''': Easy, guys. I learned at Twilight's school ganging up on each other isn't half as cool as you think.
:'''Clump''': Awww. Pony school made you soft.
:'''Smolder''': Want to try me and find out?
:'''Clump''': [gulps] M-Maybe later.
:'''Spike''': So, uh, let's get lava diving. What do you say?
:'''"Billy"''': Better stay here, shrimp. Lava might ruin your blanky-wanky.
:'''Garble''': Let the wimp tag along. Then we'll have somedragon to dunk! [laughs]
:'''Smolder''': Hmph. Only gonna warn you once. Spike's my friend. You mess with him, you mess with me. Besides, he came here to hang out with ''you'', Garble.
:[beat]
:'''Clump''', '''"Billy"''', and '''Fume''': [laughing]
:[flames roaring]
:'''"Billy"''': [mockingly] Awww. How sweet. Ha!
:'''Clump''': Let's go do dragon stuff. Garble can have fun with his new ''friend''.
:'''Clump''', '''"Billy"''', and '''Fume''': [laughing]
:[flames roaring]
:'''Garble''': But I'm not having fun! And he's not my friend! [growls]
:'''Smolder''': Eh, just ignore them, "Gar-Gar".
:'''Garble''': Smolder! Not in public!
:'''Spike''': Oh, it's okay to have a nickname. Sometimes I'm called "Spikey-Wikey".
:'''Garble''': Seriously? You're admitting this? [to Smolder] I am ''not'' hanging out with him.
:'''Smolder''': Give him a chance, Garble. You guys have a lot in common.
:'''Garble''': [groans] Fine. Race you to the lava pit.
:'''Spike''': Wait. I thought you said your brother was sweet.
:'''Smolder''': All the tough guy stuff is just an act. He's a big marshmallow.
:'''Spike''': Yeah, not seein' it.
:'''Smolder''': Well, maybe a burnt marshmallow. Smoky on the outside, but squishy inside. He just needs friends who can appreciate that part. Like you. You're not changing your mind about helping me cheer him up, are you?
:'''Spike''': Me? 'Course not! [nervous laugh, sighs]

:'''Smolder''': Okay! Lava jumping! Just like old times, huh, Gar-Gar?
:'''Garble''': Yeah. Just like old times. Except for one little ''annoying'' thing.
:'''Smolder''': Scales away!
:[splash]
:'''Smolder''': Come on in! The lava's fine!
:'''Garble''': [sighs]
:'''Spike''': You know, whenever I'm feeling a little down, it always helps if I do something with a friend. How about we jump together?
:[smack!]
:'''Spike''': Aah!
:[splash]
:[bubbling]
:'''Smolder''': Ooh... [winces] Spike? You okay?
:'''Spike''': [gasps] [stuffed] Uh, I know there must be something worse than lava up your nose. Ah... ah... [sneezes] I just don't know what it is.
:'''Garble''': Cannonball!
:[whistling through air]
:'''Spike''': Aah!
:[splash!]
:'''Garble''': Woo-hoo! [laughs] Oops?
:'''Spike''': Ah! [coughing] [strained] Swallowing lava. Swallowing lava's definitely worse.
:'''Garble''': [insincere] My bad.

:'''Fluttershy''': [reading] "...And then they all lived happily ever after." Time to come out, little ones. [baby talk] Maybe you'd like a song? [deep breath]
:'''Ember''': I think you might be encouraging them to stay in. Dragons aren't much for touchy-feely stuff.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. I'm sorry.
:[rattling]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Goodness. Why are the eggs shaking? [gasps] Are they finally hatching?
:'''Ember''': I wish. They've been doing that for days. I'm sure it means something, but it's probably not good.

:'''Spike''': Try this. Red velvet. Guaranteed to brighten anycreature's spirits.
:[smack!]
:[splat!]
:[squish!]
:'''Garble''': Feelin' better already.

:'''Spike''': I dunno about you, but a change of scenery always turns ''my'' frown upside-down. Aah!
:[flump!]
:'''Spike''': [under breath] I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon.

:'''Spike''': Sometimes, just hearing what someone appreciates about you can make you feel better about yourself.
:'''Smolder''': I'll go first. Spike, I think it's really nice that you're trying to cheer up Gar-Gar.
:'''Garble''': [groans]
:'''Spike''': Thank you, Smolder. My turn. I like how you always let everycreature know how you're feeling, Gar-Gar.
:'''Garble''': Only Smolder gets to call me that!
:'''Spike''': [pained groan] Thank you for speaking your truth. [groans]

:'''Clump''': More fresh lava comin' up!
:[crunching]
:[bubbling]
:[drain sound]
:'''Spike''': Okay. New activity. Who wants to make vision boards?
:'''"Billy"''': Hey, Garble, Smolder! Surf's up!
:[splashing]
:'''Garble''': Let ''me'' show you how it's done!
:[splashing]
:'''Smolder''': You coming?
:'''Spike''': I'll... catch up with you.
:[splashing]
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] Spike! There you are!
:'''Spike''': Hey, Fluttershy.
:'''Fluttershy''': For a land that's all rocks, this place is surprisingly easy to get lost in.
:'''Spike''': How are the baby dragons doing?
:'''Fluttershy''': The eggs won't hatch. They just keep shaking. I'm starting to think the dragons are too scared to come out. I was hoping you could help. If you're not too busy cheering up Smolder's brother.
:'''Spike''': Not a chance. Smolder's brother is Garble.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Spike''': The only thing that cheers him up is to make me miserable.
:'''Garble''': Hey, Spike! Want to play lavaball?
:[whoosh!]
:'''Spike''': Huh?
:[glop!]
:[sizzle!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Excuse me, but that's ''not'' a very nice game!
:'''Garble''' and '''Dragons''': [grunting, laughing]
:[glop! glop! glop!]
:'''Clump''': Ah! Nearly got you!
:'''Fluttershy''': [echoing] ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">ENOUGH!</span>''
:[splashes]
:'''Fluttershy''': [clears throat] I mean, leave my friend alone please. Spike came all this way to cheer up Garble, which was a very kind thing to do.
:'''"Billy"''': [to Garble, mockingly] Awwww, do you need cheering up?
:'''Clump''': What's wrong, Garble? Did somedwagon hurt your wittle feelings?
:'''Garble''': No! I-I don't know what she's talking about! Spike's the one who's gonna cry!
:'''Smolder''': Hey! Are we lava surfing or what?
:'''Garble''': Uh, yeah, yeah! [nervous laugh] Let's go hang with a ''real'' dragon, not a pony wannabe!
:'''Garble''' and '''Dragons''': [laughing]
:'''Spike''': See? It's no use. [sighs] Why don't I see what I can do about the eggs and you cheer up Garble? At least he listens to you.
:'''Fluttershy''': Just you wait, Garble. You're dealing with Fluttershy now, and she's packin' a whole lifetime of kindness!

:'''Ember''': Oh... Coochie-coochie-coo. [groans] Coochie-coochie-coo. Coochie-coochie-coo! Coochie-coochie. I said coochie—!
:'''Spike''': Uh, what are you doing?
:'''Ember''': [gasps] Spike!
:'''Spike''': Hi, Ember!
:'''Ember''': Shouldn't you be doing whatever it is you do at Twilight's school?
:'''Spike''': I wish. It's a long story. Wow. These eggs really do look scared.
:[rattling]
:'''Spike''': Wait. Aren't the hatching grounds supposed to be hot?
:'''Ember''': Uh, of course. There's a lake of molten lava under them. That's why the eggs are laid here. The heat makes them hatch.
:'''Spike''': Then something's wrong. I don't think the eggs are shaking because they're afraid. They're cold.
:'''Ember''': You're right! But what happened to the lava?
:'''Spike''': I might have an idea.

:'''Fluttershy''': Garble! Smolder! Is anydragon there?
:[bongo drums]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my. Are those... bongo drums?
:'''Garble''': Fire, dragon. Wig and waggin'. Feelin' like I be saggin'.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Smolder''': [snapping fingers] Oh, yeah. I dig.
:[bongo drums]
:'''Garble''': Ragin' lava. Balaclava.
:'''Smolder''': Huh?
:'''Garble''': Aah!

:'''Clump''': Fresh lava comin' up!
:[bubbling]
:[splash]
:'''Spike''': See? I wondered where that lava was coming from. They must be draining it from the underground lake.
:'''Ember''': [growls]
:[loud thud]
:'''Ember''': Put that rock back! Immediately!
:'''Clump''': Uh, yes, Dragon Lord Ember!
:'''Ember''': How long have you been removing these boulders?
:'''Clump''': Uhhhh... a while.
:'''"Billy"''': It made our lava pool so nice and warm-like.
:'''Ember''': [growls] It's supposed to be heating the eggs! Now they'll never hatch!

:'''Dragons''': [panicked grunts]
:'''Clump''': Sorry, Dragon Lord Ember!
:'''"Billy"''': We'll put the lava back! [panicked grunts]
:'''Clump''': [panicked grunts] Here you go, lava! Come on! So difficult! And liquid-y!
:'''Spike''': I don't think it works that way. The hatching grounds can't be the only warm place in the Dragon Lands. There's got to be somewhere else we can take the eggs.
:'''Ember''': You know how fragile those things are? No way we'll be able to move them all safely. [growls] You! Go and bring all the dragons to the hatching grounds! We'll have to make the heat ourselves!

:'''Garble''': What do you think you're doing sneaking around here, pony?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Sneaking? Looks to me like the only one sneaking around is ''you'', Garble. Why didn't you tell me you were a poet?
:'''Garble''': I'm not!
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:[bongo drum taps]
:[bongo drums]
:'''Fluttershy''': Words. Rhythm. Sometimes rhyme. Weird punctu... ation. Sure sounds like poetry to me.
:'''Smolder''': It's okay, Gar-Gar. Fluttershy won't think you're soft for being a poet. And neither would anydragon who was your real friend.
:'''Garble''': [sighs] 'Kay, fine. But I'm not a flowery, namby-pamby poet! I'm a beat poet. Dig?
:'''Fluttershy''': I totally feel you.
:'''Garble''': And you better not tell my friends about it!
:'''Fluttershy''': But why? If I was a poet, I'd want to share my creations with everypony.
:'''Smolder''': I'm the only one Garble will perform for. He hasn't written any poetry since I left. That's why he's been so sad.
:'''Garble''': I need to create. But if the other dragons ever found out I like this junk, they'd make fun of me forever.
:'''Fluttershy''': Is that why you pick on Spike? To make your friends think you're tough?
:'''Smolder''': Wait. ''You've'' been picking on Spike?
:'''Garble''': Uh... only when you're not looking. But if I didn't pick on Spike, they'd just pick on ''me''! And he ''is'' kind of a weakling.
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmph! I'll have you know Spike is stronger than you are any day!
:'''Garble''': Yeah, right! That little cupcake-making, blanket-cuddling pony-dragon? [laughs] Give me a break!
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] First of all, there's nothing wrong with being a pony! Second, Spike isn't afraid to be who he is, no matter what you or anycreature thinks! That's ''real'' strength! Not like ''some'' dragons I know.
:'''Smolder''': For a pony without a horn, she's sure got a point.
:'''Spike''': I've been looking all over for you guys! We need your help! Hurry!
:[zip!]

:[flames roaring]
:'''Ember''': I've ordered everydragon to warm up the eggs, but they still won't hatch. I don't know what else we can try.
:'''Spike''': We can't give up! There's got to be something we can do!
:'''Clump''': [mockingly] How about we wrap the eggs in a bunch of baby bwankets? [laughs]
:'''"Billy"''': [laughs] Yeah! The wimp can knit 'em up quick-like!
:'''Spike''': Hey, watch it! That laugh fire could burn somepony!
:'''Dragons''': [laughing]
:'''Garble''': Burn... Good idea, Spikey-Wikey!
:[zip!]
:'''Dragons''': [stop laughing]
:[bongo drums]
:'''Garble''': Eggs, come. Burst into that light. Break through shells that bind.
:'''Spike''': [snaps fingers]
:'''Garble''': Break free, explore. Stuck! ...Between rock and... hard place.
:[beat]
:'''Dragons''': [laughing]
:[flames roaring]
:'''Garble''': Freedom, come! Don't be shy! Look those others in the eye!
:'''Dragons''': [uproarious laughing]
:[flames roaring]
:'''Garble''': Stake your claim! Don't stop! Just do! Be the one and only... you!
:'''Dragons''': [uproarious laughing]
:[cracking]
:'''Fluttershy''': Spike, look!
:'''Spike''': What? Huh?! Their laugh fire's so hot, it's hatching the eggs!
:'''Garble''': Come to light! Proud to be! Open up! Bam! Be... free!
:'''Dragons''': [uproarious laughing]
:[cracking]
:'''Smolder''': You did it, Gar-Gar! You performed in front of other dragons!
:'''"Billy"''': [laughs] And it was super lame! What kind of weakling writes poetry?
:'''Ember''': The hero of the Dragon Lands! That's who!
:'''Smolder''': Yeah! Garble saved our eggs because he was strong enough to be who he is, whether you liked it or not. I grew up thinking it was okay to make fun of differences. But my friends have taught me to celebrate them.
:'''Dragons''': [grunting]
:'''Ember''': And from now on, in my kingdom, that's exactly what we will do. Now, if you don't mind, can you teach me how to write poetry like that? It's pretty cool.
:'''Garble''': Uh... yeah, sure. No problem!
:'''"Billy"''': Yeah, me, too!
:'''Clump''': I want to learn!
:'''Spike''': Take a number, guys.
:'''Fluttershy''': I'll take them all! [giggling]

:[rooster yawns, crows]
:'''Winona''': [eating]
:'''Applejack''': I know we've had this day marked on the calendar for quite a while, but it's finally here.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Sure is.
:'''Granny Smith''': What?
:'''Applejack''': The Confluence. A harvest a hundred moons in the makin'. When every apple comes ripe at the same time. Big Mac's been up late workin' on this schedule so we can be sure not to miss a single tree. All it'll take now is a few days o' hard work. Who's with me?
:'''Big McIntosh''': [snoring]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [groans] That looks like a lot of work.
:'''Granny Smith''': Aw, don't you worry, chick-a-bidee. We got this Confluence under control. I got us some help.
:'''Applejack''': That's great, Granny! Twilight and the others are too busy at the school to lend a hoof. We could sure use some more muscle. Who'd you get? Braeburn? Honeycrisp?
:'''Granny Smith''': [chuckles] Even better.
:[muffed meowing]
:[thud]
:[door opens]
:[cats meowing]
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Howdy, y'all!
:[scritching]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [pained yelling]
:[thud]
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Mm-hmm. Now, that's how you wake a pony up.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Goldie Delicious!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Granny told me y'all could use a helpin' hoof with this here Confluence, so I came a-runnin'.
:'''Applejack''': Well, with a harvest this big, we're grateful for all the help we can get. I guess.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': It's too bad y'all ain't ever caught the Great Seedling. He'd have granted you a perpetual harvest, Confluence or no.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Big McIntosh''': [laugh]
:'''Applejack''': The Great Seedlin'? Well now. I haven't thought about that old mare's tale for years.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': The Great Seedlin' ain't no mare's tale! He's a magical Earth spirit...

:'''Goldie Delicious''': [narrating] All the colors of the harvest that travels from farm to farm daring ponies to catch him. And those that have the ingenuity are rewarded with crops that are always in bloom.

:'''Goldie Delicious''': And he's as real as you and me!
:'''Granny Smith''': As I'm up to recall, Apple Bloom used to love settin' traps for the Great Seedlin' when she was a young'un. [laughs]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [laughs]
:'''Applejack''': Well, I'm pretty sure she's outgrown the whole thing by now. Right, Apple Bloom?
:[beat]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Or maybe I'm big enough now to finally catch him! Who's with me?!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Applejack''': Apple Bloom, you haven't hunted for the Great Seedlin' since you were little. Why would you want to start again now?
:'''Apple Bloom''': The Confluence is so big! He's bound to show up! And if we catch him, he'll make all the apples ripe all the time! Right, Goldie?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Mm-hmm. That's right, young filly.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [laughs] Just imagine. Sweet Apple Acres would be the busiest orchard in Equestria! Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do!
:[door opens]
:'''Applejack''': Don't forget we have actual work to do, too!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Nothin' like a little filly enjoyin' the harvest. [chuckles]
:'''Applejack''': I don't mind Apple Bloom havin' fun. But there's honest-to-goodness work to do that doesn't have a thing to do with an old legend.
:'''Granny Smith''': Aw, quit worryin', sugar booger. Apple Bloom can hunt for the Seedlin' all she wants. If you're so fret-a-fied about work, why don't you and your brother get to buckin' your own selves?
:'''Applejack''': Granny's right.
:[cat yowls]
:'''Applejack''': Come on, sleepyhead. Let's get to work.
:'''Big McIntosh''': [yawns] Eeyup...
:[cat yowls]

:[thud]
:'''Applejack''': Hyah! Hwah!
:[apples thudding]
:'''Granny Smith''': [chuckles] ...and if you had two o' them, it would've been a "pair o' pears"!
:'''Granny Smith''' and '''Goldie Delicious''': [laughing]
:[crack]
:'''Applejack''': As much as I appreciate her volunteerin', I'm not sure how much help Goldie's gonna be.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Oh, now, that reminds me of the time Dottie – that's my cheetah, you understand – she found out where I keep the catnip.
:'''Granny Smith''' and '''Goldie Delicious''': [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': I love hearin' her and Granny spinnin' yarns, but it looks like the harvestin's up to us. You're gonna have to redo that schedule.
:'''Big McIntosh''': [sighs] Eeyup.
:'''Applejack''': And as much as I'd rather Apple Bloom were helpin', I guess there's no harm in her huntin' the Great Seedlin' for a day. Right? Big Mac!
:'''Big McIntosh''': [snores, yells]
:[thud]
:[whip!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [yells]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Gotcha! Awww. You ain't the Great Seedlin'.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nope.
:[whap!]

:[rooster crows]
:[sizzling]
:'''Applejack''': We fell behind a bit yesterday, so we need everypony at their best.
:[cat meows]
:'''Goldie Delicious''': If ''that's'' your brother's best, we might be done for. Mm-hmm.
:[hooves rattling]
:[thud]
:'''Applejack''': He was just up late workin' out a new schedule so we can stay on track.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I didn't sleep either! I was too excited! I can't wait to see if I caught the Great Seedlin'!
:[door opens]
:'''Applejack''': I hope you're ready to cheer Apple Bloom up when her traps come up empty.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Everypony! Come quick! You got to see!
:'''Applejack''': What in blazes is all the excitement about?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Look!
:[whimsical music]
:'''Apple Bloom''': The Great Seedlin' did this! Didn't he?!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Well, braid my mane! These sure look like Great Seedlin' tracks to me!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Ha! I knew it! He ''was'' here! The Great Seedlin' was here! Ain't that amazin', Applejack?!
:'''Applejack''': Yeah... Amazin'...
:'''Goldie Delicious''': [laughs]

:'''Apple Bloom''': [gasps] Isn't it beautiful? I just can't believe the Great Seedlin' was really here!
:'''Applejack''': Neither can I.
:'''Apple Bloom''': What do you think this means?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': [laughs] Well, it looks to me like a challenge. The Seedling wants ''you'' to know that he was here, and he's daring you to catch him. Mm-hmm.
:'''Apple Bloom''': You think I still have a chance?
:'''Granny Smith''': You're an Apple, ain't ya?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Why, if you set enough traps, you're bound to catch him.
:'''Apple Bloom''': You're right! And that's just what I'm gonna do! Look out, Great Seedlin'! Here I come! [giggles]
:'''Granny Smith''' and '''Goldie Delicious''': [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': Now, why would you go and do a thing like that?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': A thing like what?
:'''Applejack''': You know what I mean. We got enough work to do without you distractin' Apple Bloom by makin' some apple tracks and ''pretendin'<nowiki />'' the Great Seedlin' did it.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': [gasps] I did no such thing!
:'''Granny Smith''': What in the tater tarnation would make you say a thing like that?!
:'''Applejack''': Well, somepony did it. And ''she'' sure seems to be enjoyin' this quite a lot.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': I'm enjoyin' it because Apple Bloom's enjoyin' it!
:'''Applejack''': Uh-huh. And I suppose you two didn't do it either?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnnope.
:'''Granny Smith''': O' course not. But I suppose it could've been Goldie's cats! Why don't you ask them?
:[cat meows]
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Have you considered that maybe it was the Great Seedlin' after all?
:'''Applejack''': Ha-ha. Very funny.
:'''Granny Smith''': I swear, sometimes I think she's part mule.

:[clattering]
:'''Applejack''': Apple Bloom?
:'''Apple Bloom''': You know where there's more rope? I've got a lot of traps to make if I'm gonna catch the Great Seedlin'.
:[toy squeaks]
:'''Applejack''': That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I know you're excited, but we sure could use your help today. Are you sure you want to spend time tryin' to catch somethin' that... might not even be real?
:'''Apple Bloom''': What? But the Great Seedlin' ''is'' real. You saw the tracks. You think those appeared all by themselves?
:'''Applejack''': I don't know who made the tracks. But I don't think it was the Great Seedlin'.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Why not?
:'''Applejack''': Because the Great Seedlin' is just somethin' to make the harvest fun for young'uns. And you're old enough now to know that there's a time for fun and there's a time for work.
:'''Apple Bloom''': But catchin' the Great Seedlin' ''is'' helpin'! He can make the trees blossom all the time!
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] All right. How about this? If you help me with the harvest today, I'll help you set traps for the Great Seedlin' tonight. Deal?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Woo-hoo! Yes! It's a deal!

:[apples thudding]
:[barrels creaking]
:[thunk!]
:[apples thudding]
:'''Applejack''': Kinda looks like those Seedlin' tracks, huh?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Sure. If there were hundreds of apples in a bunch of different lines.
:'''Applejack''': Well, if enough apples fell or got knocked down by the wind maybe. Or animals.
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': I'm just sayin' there's a lot of possible explanations.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': And one o' them is the Great Seedlin'!
:'''Applejack''': And the rest of 'em ''ain't''!
:'''Granny Smith''': That ain't what you thought when you was a foal.
:'''Apple Bloom''': What does that mean?
:'''Granny Smith''': Your sister was plumb loco about catchin' the Great Seedlin' when she was your age. Same as you are now. Worse, even.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Oh, is that so? Do tell, Granny.
:'''Granny Smith''': Well, it must've been the last Conflu-inky, I reckon. I was supposed to keep an eye on your sister, but...

:'''Granny Smith''': [voiceover] ...she was slipperier than an apple seed.
:'''Granny Smith''': Applejack! Get your flank back here! You're supposed to be sortin' in the barn!
:'''Young Applejack''': Sorry, Granny! I got to check my traps, or the Great Seedlin' might get away!
:[leaves rustling]
:'''Young Applejack''': Now, where'd I put that trap?
:[twig snaps]
:'''Young Applejack''': [gasps] Whoa!
:[thud]
:'''Granny Smith''': Bust my buds. Where's that young'un get to?
:'''Granny Smith''': [voiceover] She spent the better half of the day stuck in that trap! [laughs]
:'''Applejack''': [voiceover] And missed out on helpin' with the harvest because I was chasin' somethin' for little foals. I felt guilty everypony else had to work harder because of me. So I decided right then and there I was too old to waste any more time on Great Seedlin'.

:'''Granny Smith''': Oh, we finished the harvest just fine. But we laughed about that story for years! [laughs]
:'''Goldie Delicious''': [laughs] I'm still laughin'!
:'''Apple Bloom''': I'm sorry that happened, Applejack, but it won't if you and me set traps together like you promised. Plus, we'll get 'em done twice as fast and won't miss out on any of the harvest!
:'''Applejack''': Then let's get to work.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [gasps]

:[montage music]
:[rope stretching]
:[twang!]
:[snap!]
:[crunch!]

:[leaves rustling]
:[thud]
:[apples thudding]
:[cats meowing]
:'''Winona''': [barking, yelps]
:[thud]
:'''Winona''': [panting]

:[tree straining]
:[twang!]
:[thud]

:[cans clattering]
:[leaves rustling]

:'''Apple Bloom''': [laughs] It sure was fun settin' up all those traps together.
:'''Applejack''': [laughs] I forgot what a good time it could be. If any two ponies can catch the Great Seedlin', it's us.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I can't wait to check in the mornin'.
:'''Applejack''': Now, there's still plenty of harvestin' to do. So promise me you'll help, even if all our traps are empty.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I promise. So long as you're ready for the bountiful harvest the Great Seedlin's gonna give us when one of our traps nab him!
:'''Applejack''': [laughs] Deal.
:[door opens]

:[rooster crows]
:[rumbling]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Apple Bloom''': [panting]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Come on, Applejack! If we hurry, we can check every trap and still stay on schedule!
:'''Applejack''': Now that's what I like to hea—
:[whimsical music]
:'''Applejack''': Whoa.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [gasps] I don't believe it!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': This must've taken all night.
:[smack!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Nothin'!
:'''Applejack''': Huh?
:'''Apple Bloom''': I checked all the traps near the tracks! Every one was sprung, but they're all empty!
:'''Applejack''': Every trap sprung? No way critters did this. Or the wind. I can't believe I'm sayin' this, but... maybe the Great Seedlin' really ''was'' here!

:'''Goldie Delicious''': So, you're finally ready to admit the Great Seedling might be real?
:'''Applejack''': I can't think of anything else that could've laid out these tracks ''and'' sprung all our traps.
:'''Apple Bloom''': And if he left this many tracks behind, he's practically beggin' us to catch him!
:'''Granny Smith''': I ain't never seen anything like this before.
:'''Applejack''': Well, tell us what you ''have'' seen! Goldie, you too! We need to know it all if we're really gonna catch him!
:'''Granny Smith''': Sure, Goldie and I'll tell you all about the Great Seedling all day. While we work.
:'''Applejack''': Work? Apple Bloom and I don't have time to work today! We've got to set up traps in every row! Even the carrots! Just to be sure!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Yesterday you said the Great Seedlin' was just somethin' to make the harvest fun for young'uns.
:'''Applejack''': That was before I thought we could actually catch him! Besides...
:'''Big McIntosh''': [yawns]
:'''Applejack''': ...Big Mac can make time in the schedule for us to set traps, right?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Uh... eeyup?
:'''Applejack''': Great! Get to it! Apple Bloom and I are gonna go capture us the Great Seedlin'!

:'''Big McIntosh''': [sighs]
:[thud]
:[apples thudding]
:[multiple thuds]
:[apples thudding]
:[barrel creaking]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [wheezes]
:[multiple thuds]
:[thud]
:[leaves rustling]
:'''Winona''': [barking]
:'''Applejack''': Whew! All right! Just one more hill to go!
:'''Apple Bloom''': What's wrong, Big Mac?
:'''Applejack''': Huh. Is this right?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Applejack''': But that doesn't make any sense. How can all these trees be bare if we haven't bucked 'em yet?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Seems like more work of the Great Seedlin' to me.
:'''Apple Bloom''': How do you mean?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': The closer you get to catchin' the critter, the more mischievous he gets.
:'''Applejack''': You're sayin' the Great Seedlin' is takin' our apples?
:'''Granny Smith''': Yes. Sounds like he's fixin' to throw you off the scent.
:[thudding]
:[cats meowing]
:'''Applejack''': Have you ever heard of anypony actually catchin' him?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Oh, there are stories. But it's hard to say for sure. He's quite a trickster. Guess that's why the reward is so great if you ''can'' trap him.
:'''Applejack''': Well, his tricks have given me an idea. Settin' traps is one thing. But I reckon if we keep watch over the trees that haven't been bucked, the Seedlin' won't know what hit him!
:'''Apple Bloom''': That's a great idea! Anypony else want to stay up with us?
:'''Granny Smith''': Ah, no. A pony like me needs her beauty rest. But you young'uns have a good time.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': My kitties can't sleep unless they're curled up on my haunches. [titters] But I can't wait to see the Great Seedlin' with my own eyes once you catch him.
:'''Applejack''': Guess it's just you and me.
:[paper tears]

:'''Apple Bloom''': Too bad nopony else wanted to come out. But I'm glad we're doin' this together.
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Me, too. It's been a long time since I was on a real Seedlin' hunt. And this is the first time doin' it with my little sister.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [yawns] When did you start tryin' to catch the Great Seedlin'?
:'''Applejack''': I couldn't have been much more than a foal. I remember our parents tuckin' Big Mac and me in and tellin' us all about the Great Seedlin'. And I got so excited, I could barely sleep. So I—
:'''Apple Bloom''': [snoring]
:'''Applejack''': Don't you worry, sugarcube. I won't let him get away.

:'''Applejack''': [snoring]
:[clatter!]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [yelps]
:[thud]
:[apples thudding]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [whispering] Applejack, wake up!
:'''Applejack''': Huh? W-What is it?
:'''Apple Bloom''': [whispering] I think a trap went off!
:'''Applejack''': Well, let's go check it out!

:'''Applejack''': See anything?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Mm-mm.
:'''Applejack''': Don't scare him off. We got to lead him into one of the traps.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [whimpers] I'm not worried about scarin' ''him''.
:[galloping]
:[twig snaps]
:[leaves rustling]
:[thud]
:[apples thudding]
:[cans clattering]
:'''Apple Bloom''': ''I think the Great Seedlin's huntin' us!'' [screams]
:'''Applejack''': Apple Bloom! Wait!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [panting]
:[twang!]
:'''Applejack''': [panting] Huh?
:'''Apple Bloom''': [whimpering] Applejack!
:'''Applejack''': Huh?
:'''Applejack''' and '''Apple Bloom''': [scream]
:'''Applejack''': [panting]
:[thudding]
:[rattling]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [snoring]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Apple Bloom''': Big Mac?!
:'''Applejack''': He's been harvestin' in his sleep this whole time!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Big Mac is the Great Seedlin'?!
:'''Big McIntosh''': [mumbling] Aah!
:[whiffle!]
:[thud!]
:'''Applejack''': Y-You okay, Big Mac?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnnope.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Apple Bloom''': [laugh]

:'''Applejack''': ...And thanks to all of Big Mac's late-night work, we brought in the whole harvest with time to spare.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': No wonder you were so tired all the time.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I'm glad we solved the mystery, but I really wanted to catch the Great Seedlin' before I get too old to try.
:'''Applejack''': You know what, sugarcube? You're never too old to be a filly. There will always be work to do, but havin' fun together is somethin' you never grow out of.
:'''Winona''': [panting]
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Well, looks like you don't need me anymore. Time to get home before Dottie gets in the catnip again. I have stories about that, I'll tell you what.
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] We're real glad you came, Goldie.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Sure are! Come back next year!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': [whistles]
:[cats meowing]
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Oh. Looks like you forgot to clean up the carrots.
:'''Applejack''': Huh. Big Mac wasn't harvestin' the carrots. Just the apples.
:'''Big McIntosh''': ["I-don't-know" sound]
:[whimsical music]
:'''Applejack''': You know what this means?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Time for another hunt!
:'''Applejack''': Look out, Great Seedlin'! Here we come!

:'''Trixie''': I know how hard you've been working lately, so I figured you could use a break.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps] Trixie, this looks amazing! But my job doesn't really seem like work.
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh! Speaking of...
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': [sighs, blows, sips]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sure, being counselor for the students at Twilight's School of Friendship is demanding, but—
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh. One sec.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': [sips]
:[spoon clattering]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What was I saying? Oh, right. Being able to use the experiences of my checkered past and help young students feels pretty great. Oh, yum! [chomps] Mmm, thanks!
:'''Trixie''': Of course I feel nothing but admiration for the work you do, but it is a little all-consuming. And I miss spending time with you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What are you talking about? We're spending time right now.
:'''Trixie''': Well...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [chewing]
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [mouth full] Hold that thought.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': [growls, chomps]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Sorry. I cast a spell on the door to my office so this bracelet goes off whenever there's a knock. Yona is having the worst time with her braids lately. [sips] Anyway, you were saying?
:'''Trixie''': [sips]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs nervously]

:'''Silverstream''': I totally respect my younger cousins' decisions to stay seaponies, but they've never been on dry land. Preparing for a visit with them is almost as much work as the research assignment Headmare Twilight gave me on hazardous fauna of the Everfree Forest! How would ''you'' describe a shower to creatures who live in water? So far, I've got "warm" and "steamy". Actually, steam has water in it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Silverstream, there are a lot of students who want to see me today.
:'''Silverstream''': I just need a few shower adjectives... that don't rely on the wet part.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Well, there's "clean", "relaxing", um...
:'''Silverstream''': "Relaxing"... I don't know. A nap's relaxing, too. "Warm" and "clean" are okay. Wow. I have to give this some more thought.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh. Okay. Well, I'm here to help. My door is always open.
:'''Trixie''': Except for today, of course.
:[door closes]
:'''Student Pony''': [whimpers]
:'''Trixie''': If we leave now, we can finish everything before sundown.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, I-I can't leave. It's almost spring break. Twilight and the others have already left to celebrate the spring solstice in Canterlot, and I have to help the students with any issues before ''they'' head home for the holiday.
:[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Trixie''': I know you're busy, but I hope you haven't forgotten about the Spring Solst-astic!
:[beat]
:'''Trixie''': The party Maud and Mudbriar are throwing?
:[beat]
:'''Trixie''': Sunburst is coming to town?
:[beat]
:'''Trixie''': You and I promised to make the cake?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [scoffs] How could I possibly forget about that?
:[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Trixie''': [low growl]
:[door closes]

:'''Trixie''': Nopony is saying your job isn't important, but plans you make with your friends are important, too.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have forgotten. Obviously I need to be available to my students, but that doesn't mean I can't help with all the things we have to do.
:'''Trixie''': Good!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Great!
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So... what ''are'' all the things we have to do?
:'''Trixie''': [whines] Maud needs streamers for the decorations. Sunburst wants us to pick up a genuine pre-Equestrian spring solstice chafing dish from the antique shop.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Of course he does.
:'''Trixie''': Mudbriar wants a bouquet of flowering sticks – whatever that means. And I thought we were ''both'' looking forward to Mrs. Cake teaching us the secret recipe to her famous spring solstice cake.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh! I-I totally am! [chuckles] But we could just buy a cake from her, right?
:'''Trixie''': We could... but then we'd miss out on baking ''together''. Plus, the time I spent flattering and convincing and begging her to share the recipe with you for nothing! And we promised to ''make'' a cake, not ''buy'' a cake! And the Great and Powerful Trixie ''keeps her promises!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay! Why don't we just split up these jobs? I'll get the streamers and the chafing dish. You—
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': —get started on those sticks, and I'll be right back! [laughs nervously] You know, why don't I just hang on to this? Wouldn't want to forget the things I just said I'd take care of. Because I am totally gonna take care of them!
:[teleportation zap]

:'''Rose''': Could it be plum blossom?
:'''Trixie''': I have no idea.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': [yelps]
:[thud]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whoops! Heh. Sorry, Rose. But I need a bouquet of flowering sticks, stat!
:'''Trixie''': I thought ''I'' was getting the flowering sticks.
:'''Rose''': Uh, I'm still not exactly sure what they are.
:'''Trixie''': No one is.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Right. Got it. You get the sticks. I'll get the streamers—
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': —riiiight after I take care of what I'm sure is an even smaller student problem than the last one! [laughs nervously]
:[teleportation zap]
:[glue squirting]

:'''Silverstream''': I think I have the shower thing under control. But I can't figure out how to describe a towel.

:[bracelet chiming]
:[teleportation zap]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Now, Smolder, I understand the school can be a bit drafty, but that doesn't mean you can breathe fire anywhere you want!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What do you mean Trixie already picked up Sunburst's genuine pre-Equestrian equinox chafing dish?! That was ''my'' job! I think. Wait. Was it?
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:[teleportation zap]

:[transformation zaps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Ocellus, it's perfectly normal for a changeling to struggle with identity issues, but—
:'''Silverstream''': Counselor Starlight!
:[door opens]
:'''Silverstream''': When you're done, I need some synonyms for the word "dry". Or, really, just help explaining the concept.

:[door closes]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wait, Mrs. Cake! You can't close! Trixie and I need to learn the recipe for your equinox cake!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, it's fine, dear. Trixie was already here. I told her everything she needs to know.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What? No! Aww! The Great and Powerful Trixie might keep her promises, but the Busy and Distracted Starlight sure doesn't. I promised to help her today, and I haven't done a single thing.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, that doesn't sound hard, dear. A-And I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but [whispering] your hoof is glowing.
:[bracelet chiming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Of course it is.
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:[click]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie? What are you doing here?
:'''Trixie''': It's the one place I knew I could find you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I am so sorry about today. I'm just so—
:'''Trixie''': Busy. I know. Obviously your students are more important than your friends.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's not—!
:[bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Silverstream''': Starlight, you have a minute?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually, Silverstream, I don't. Besides, I need to lock up the school for the holiday, and it's time ''you'' caught the train home. I'm sure a smart and capable student like you can figure out the solution to any problem over the break. But for now, the counselor's office is closed.
:[door closes]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I have a cake to bake.

:[clatter]
:'''Sunburst''': Yow! Is this cake supposed to be so sharp?
:'''Trixie''': [growls]
:'''Sunburst''': I mean, it looks really... interesting?
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, it's not symmetrical or aesthetically pleasing.
:'''Trixie''': [growls]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Maybe it's not the best cake. But we made it together, and that's what counts.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I'm glad you brought it. And everything else. I'm very excited. This is going to be the most perfect party ever.
:'''Trixie''': And with all of your students home for the holiday, I won't have to worry about you being summoned to your office in the middle of it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Mm-hmm. Nothing is gonna take me away from this party.
:'''Terramar''': Hello?! Starlight?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [spits]
:'''Terramar''': Starlight?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Sorry. This is a private cavern.
:'''Terramar''': Is Starlight here?! I was told she'd be here!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What's wrong?
:'''Terramar''': I'm Terramar, Silverstream's brother. I've been looking all over for you. Silverstream is missing!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps]
:'''Trixie''': [chewing]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I don't understand. Silverstream didn't come home?
:'''Terramar''': Mm-mm. I was supposed to meet her at the Mount Aris train station, but she never showed up!
:'''Sunburst''': It's a long way between Ponyville and Mount Aris. She could be anywhere.
:'''Terramar''': Our parents are leading teams of Hippogriffs and seaponies, searching the land and sea between here and our home. They sent me to check the school.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But the school's closed. All the students are gone.
:'''Terramar''': Are you sure? I know she had a big project due for Twilight. Do you think she might've stayed to finish it?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': She never told me about a project.
:'''Trixie''': Well, to be fair, you closed your office the last time she came by.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?
:'''Trixie''': [short laugh]
:'''Terramar''': What kind of counselor turns away a student with a problem?!
:'''Trixie''': The kind with too much on her plate! Starlight has always gone out of her way for her students. And I mean ''always''.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Except apparently when it matters. This is all my fault! You all go back to the party. Terramar and I will check the school. We'll find your sister.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I should've known it couldn't last. Party perfection is more of a Pinkie thing.
:'''Mudbriar''': Mm. I wasn't going to say anything, but these flowers are just glued on, so technically, it wasn't perfect already.
:[beat]
:'''Mudbriar''': But that's probably not important.

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You check the grounds, and I'll look inside.

:[doors open]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Silverstream?
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [echoing] Hello?
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zaps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Anycreature?!

:[splash]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Terramar''': [panting] She's not down here.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I don't see her anywhere.
:'''Terramar''': Did you check her room?
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, she's not here.
:'''Terramar''': No, she isn't. But look at this.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': A cockatrice?
:'''Terramar''': Could that be what her project was on? You don't think she went into the Everfree Forest to find a cockatrice by herself, do you?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
:[teleportation zap]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs nervously]
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''All''': [yelps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What are you all doing here?
:'''Sunburst''': We came to help.
:'''Trixie''': We couldn't let you handle this alone.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, she wasn't alone.
:[beat]
:'''Mudbriar''': But we wanted to help anyway.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Thanks. All of you. But the students are ''my'' responsibility. I'm the one who didn't do my job when it actually mattered.
:'''Trixie''': I... might share a bit of the blame for pressuring you into leaving work early.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But I don't want to ruin your party.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] We can still have a party. A search party.
:'''Terramar''': Can we talk about all this later? Silverstream might be in the Everfree Forest alone!
:'''Trixie''' and '''Sunburst''': [gasp]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We think she went in to do research on cockatrices.
:'''Sunburst''': What?! The gaze of the cockatrice is known to petrify any who dare to cross its path! ''And'' the reptilian birds are elusive and solitary! W-Where would we even start?!
:'''Trixie''': I have a lot of experience telling ponies that I have experience with the dangerous creatures of Everfree Forest! Follow me!
:[zip!]

:[tense music]
:'''Trixie''': The Great and Directionally Astute Trixie says we go left!

:'''Trixie''': This way!

:'''Trixie''': [sniffs]
:[wind whistling]

:[owl hoots]

:'''Trixie''': [slurp, chews, spits]

:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Weren't we just here?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, do you have any idea how to find a cockatrice?
:'''Trixie''': No. But usually, when there's a dangerous creature in the forest I don't want to meet, this is how I meet them.
:'''Sunburst''': We might need a more concrete plan.
:'''Trixie''': Hmph. Suit yourself.
:'''Terramar''': Um, according to Silverstream's research, the cockatrice prefers rocky terrain and ample shade.
:'''Trixie''': Rocks and shade. Hmm. I can't imagine where we'll find ''that'' in a forest.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the most hospitable environment for shade trees.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, pine trees like Pinus cembra or Pinus sylvestris ''can'' grow from narrow crevasses or cracks in a rocky rhizosphere.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You complete me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': There's some pine trees over there!

:[cockatrices clucking and hissing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [whispering] I thought you said they were solitary!
:'''Sunburst''': [whispering] They are! This must be some kind of migration.
:'''Terramar''': [whimpers] At least there's no sign of Silverstream. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of that flock.
:'''Trixie''': [whispering] It's just lucky we're all over here and they're all over there.
:[cockatrice hisses]
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically—
:'''Trixie''': [whispering] Don't even say it!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whatever you do, don't look at them. Their gaze can turn you to stone.
:'''Terramar''': [whispering] So what do we do?
:[cockatrices hiss]
:'''Sunburst''': ''Ruuuuun!''
:[teleportation zap]

:[cockatrices squawk]
:'''Sunburst''': [screaming]
:[thud]
:'''Sunburst''': [groans, babbles]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sunburst!
:[magic zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': Aah!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Stop! It's me!
:'''Sunburst''': Starlight! I'm so sorry. We have to get out of here.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know. Hang on.
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We can't leave Silverstream might still be in the forest. Stay here. I'll get the others.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Sunburst''': Be careful!

:[clucking and hissing]
:'''Terramar''': The clucking is coming from everywhere!
:'''Trixie''': The Great and Powerful Trixie fears no cluck!
:[poof!]
:[cockatrices hiss]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Come on!
:[teleportation zap]
:[cockatrices hiss]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Sunburst''': Aah!
:[teleportation zap]

:[cockatrices hiss]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Maud! We've got to get out of here!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I'm not leaving him.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps]
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''', '''Sunburst''', and '''Terramar''': [gasps]
:'''Sunburst''': Mudbriar's been turned to stone?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I didn't think I could love him any more.
:'''Trixie''': We've got to get out of here!
:'''Terramar''': But we haven't found Silverstream! We can't leave yet!
:[cockatrices hiss]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, we can't stay here! Come on!
:[cockatrices hissing]
:[leaves rustling]
:[cockatrice clucks]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [screams]
:[cockatrices hissing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': This way!
:[cockatrices hiss]

:[thudding]
:'''Trixie''': Now what?!
:'''Sunburst''': Let's hope Silverstream found a good place to hide. There could be hundreds more cockatrices on the way. If this really is a migration, it'll take a full lunar cycle to complete.
:'''Terramar''': Ohhh. I have to get word back to our parents that Silverstream could be surrounded by those terrifying birds!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] And as handsome as Mudbriar is now, we should probably catch one of them to turn him back to normal.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] This ''is'' all my fault. I'm never taking time off from my counseling duties again.
:'''Trixie''': That seems a little extreme.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?! If I hadn't galloped off to a holiday celebration, Silverstream would be safe with her family, and you'd all be enjoying Maud's party! Instead, my student is missing, we're surrounded by a flock of petrifying chicken-snakes, ''and'' Maud's boyfriend was turned into a hunk of rock!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You got the "hunk" part right.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And to top it off, we have no idea if Silverstream even came to Everfree at all! But I have no idea where else to look!
:'''Trixie''': Has that always been there?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What? Oh, that's the students' treehouse. Apparently it grew from the Tree of Harmony and— [gasps] Of course! That should've been the first place we looked!
:[scraping]
:[door opens]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs, gasps] Silverstream, look out!
:'''Silverstream''': Counselor Starlight, no!
:'''Edith''': [hisses]
:'''Silverstream''': Wait!
:[magic humming]
:'''Edith''': [clucking softly]
:'''Silverstream''': This is Edith. She's helping me with my project.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I... don't understand.
:'''Silverstream''': After you encouraged me to solve my own problem, I decided to get my project done before I left. That way, I could really focus on my family during my visit. The school was closed, so I came here.
:'''Terramar''': Why didn't you tell anyone? Mom and Dad are worried sick!
:'''Silverstream''': Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Once Edith volunteered to help, I guess I lost track of time. Cockatrices are really friendly if you know how to interact with them.
:'''Edith''': [clucking softly]
:'''Sunburst''': I can't believe you figured out how to trigger her nesting response.
:'''Silverstream''': They are really fascinating creatures. Did you know that they migrate to the Everfree Forest once a year? Can you imagine what would happen if you stumble on a whole flock of these?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I have a few ideas.
:'''Silverstream''': [gasps]

:'''Silverstream''': I'm sorry you got turned to stone looking for me. But I'm glad Edith was able to turn you back.
:'''Sunburst''': [hushed, to Trixie] How do you tell the difference?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I have mixed feelings about it.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, I will always be a stick pony. But the experience has given me an even deeper appreciation for the density and permanence of rock.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Swoon.
:'''Terramar''': Silverstream and I should get going. But I wanted to thank you for everything you did to help find her.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I just wish I hadn't abandoned her in the first place.
:'''Trixie''': Starlight, you didn't abandon her.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I might as well have. Even though it turned out all right, things could've been a lot worse.
:'''Sunburst''': You can't be expected to supervise your students every second of every day.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm not so sure.
:'''Silverstream''': I like that you're always available, but it kind of makes it okay to come to you with stuff that maybe isn't super important.
:'''Trixie''': Of course being a school counselor is a big responsibility. But always being at work isn't fair to anypony. Especially me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Do you think if I had set times to see me, it might help you decide what you ''really'' need to talk about?
:'''Silverstream''': To be honest, you really weren't very helpful with the other stuff anyway.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah— Wait, what?!
:'''Trixie''': Happy Spring Solst-astic, everypony! Who wants a piece of Mrs. Cake's famous—?
:[clang!]
:'''Sunburst''': Petrified dessert?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You had me at "petrified".
:'''All except Maud Pie''': [laughing]

:'''Skeedaddle''': [panting] Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders!
:'''Scootaloo''': We're at my house!
:[door opens]
:'''Skeedaddle''': I got my cutie mark!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You did?
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': That's great, Skeedaddle!
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah! What's it for?
:'''Skeedaddle''': Knot-tying! And I never would've gotten it without all of you!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Did we suggest knot-tying?
:'''Skeedaddle''': [to Sweetie Belle] First, I tried sailing, like you said. [to Scootaloo] Next, I tried fishing, like ''you'' said. [to Apple Bloom] Then, I tried rowing, like ''you'' said. But my oar broke. So I used my fishing line to tie it back together, ''and I got my cutie mark!'' [squeals] I can't wait to tell everypony!
:[zip!]
:[door closes]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]
:'''Aunt Holiday''': Oh, how exciting. You three truly have a gift for helping ponies.
:'''Scootaloo''': Aw, thanks, Aunt Holiday. But I'm not sure we can take credit for this one.
:'''Aunt Holiday''': Of course you can. You encouraged that colt to try new things. And because you all believed in him, he succeeded.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': I could use that kind of help. Huh.
:'''Scootaloo''': [laughs] Come on, Auntie Lofty. You already have your cutie mark.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': Lot of good it does me. I can't decide what theme to give this quilt. Ah, I've run out of inspiration.
:'''Apple Bloom''': How about apples? Puppies? Kites!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Or cotton candy! Or ballet!
:'''Scootaloo''': What about a Wonderbolt quilt?
:'''Auntie Lofty''': [laughs] See? Leave it to you three to come up with more ideas than I've had in a year! Now, ''that's'' talent.
:[cuckoo clock]
:'''Aunt Holiday''': Goodness. We'd better get going, or we'll miss our train home. I left you plenty of healthy food for the weekend.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': And ''I'' left you cookies. [chuckles]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [gasp]
:'''Aunt Holiday''': The Cakes will stay with you tonight. Then Rarity, and Rainbow Dash after that. Remember, we're just a few stops from Ponyville if you need us.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': She knows, Holiday. See you next week, slugger.
:'''Scootaloo''': Bye, Aunt Holiday! Bye, Auntie Lofty!
:[door closes]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Your aunts are so nice.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Yeah. It's really cool they watch you while your parents are gone.
:'''Scootaloo''': I know. I just wish they lived closer. Nopony bakes like Auntie Lofty.
:[knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Scootaloo''': [gasps] They're coming home today!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Who?
:'''Scootaloo''': ''My parents!''

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Cheerilee''': Today, we're gonna learn about the Pegasus Weather Factory.
:[door creaks]
:'''Cheerilee''': Once everypony is in their seats.
:[door closes]
:'''Cheerilee''': The factory specializes in snow, rain, sunshine, and... [clears throat] Scootaloo? May I help you?
:'''Scootaloo''': I... just noticed your erasers needed dusting. [nervous laugh]
:[soft thuds]
:'''Cheerilee''' and '''foals''': [coughing]
:'''Cheerilee''': Why don't we hold off on the lesson until after lunch? How about show and tell? Does anypony have any—?
:'''Scootaloo''': ''My parents are coming home to Ponyville today!''
:'''Snips''': Wait. They don't live here?
:'''Scootaloo''': Nope. Their jobs are way too important for that. They travel to the farthest, most dangerous places in Equestria to study unknown plants and fierce creatures. And what they learn helps pony science and medicine. I'd go with them, but it's too dangerous. Once, my mom had to wing-wrestle a wyvern, and my dad got trapped in a chimera's cave for three moons! He still has the scars to prove it.
:'''Snips''': [scoffs] You're making that up. Nopony has that kind of job.
:[loud thuds]
:[cragadile roars]
:'''Foals''': [gasp, scream]
:'''Cheerilee''': It's a cragadile!
:[cragadile growling]
:[crash!]
:'''Snap Shutter''': Easy there, Marshmallow! Time you were in your crate for your nap! [grunting]
:[cragadile growling]
:'''Mane Allgood''': And that means now, mister!
:[cragadile whimpers]
:[clunk]
:[door closes]
:'''Scootaloo''': [gasps] Mom! Dad! [squeals]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Still think she's makin' it all up?
:'''Snips''': Nuh-uh...
:'''Scootaloo''': Everypony, meet my parents – Snap Shutter and Mane Allgood!
:'''Snap Shutter''': Heh. Sorry to make such an entrance. Just brought back a few mates from our last adventure.
:'''Mane Allgood''': We couldn't wait another moment to see Scootaloo! I hope we didn't interrupt anything.
:[hooves rattling]
:'''Cheerilee''': No, I, uh... think... class is dismissed.

:[students chattering]
:'''Snap Shutter''': Crikey! You're nearly as tall as me now, Scoot!
:'''Scootaloo''': Aw, come on, Dad.
:'''Mane Allgood''': Oh, Scootaloo. We missed you.
:'''Scootaloo''': Me, too, Mom. Did you get all my letters?
:'''Mane Allgood''': And read them twenty times! But they're never as good as the real thing. It's so good to see you.
:'''Snap Shutter''': I say we celebrate with ice cream sundaes. They don't have those in the jungle, that's for sure.
:'''Mane Allgood''': Why don't you all come? Our treat.

:'''Scootaloo''': And Princess Twilight said we're such good friendship tutors, she might even let us teach a class!
:'''Snap Shutter''': Good on ya, Scoot!
:'''Mane Allgood''': What an honor!
:'''Scootaloo''': I can give you a tour of the school if you want. I mean, if you're staying for a while this time.
:'''Snap Shutter''': Oh, you'll be seeing plenty of us.
:'''Scootaloo''': Really?!
:'''Mane Allgood''': Mm-hmm. Because we've taken a new job assignment that will let all of us live together!
:'''Scootaloo''': I can't believe it! That's awesome!
:'''Apple Bloom''': All right, Scootaloo!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Woo-hoo!
:'''Snap Shutter''': We never planned to be away for so long in the first place. We just kept discovering things that could help Equestria. And nopony else had the experience to finish our job.
:'''Mane Allgood''': But with all that's happened lately – Sombra's return, the destruction of the Tree of Harmony – we decided our family should be together.
:'''Scootaloo''': This is the best day of my life.
:'''Snap Shutter''': We'll stay in town for the weekend so you can pack your things.
:'''Scootaloo''': Wait, what?!
:'''Mane Allgood''': We're all moving to Shire Lanka! That's where our new job is.
:'''Scootaloo''': But... my friends are in Ponyville.
:'''Snap Shutter''': You can come back and visit 'em. Or they can take the train to us. There's one every month.
:'''Apple Bloom''': But Scootaloo can't leave!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We've been together our whole lives!
:'''Mane Allgood''': It'll be a big change for everypony. But it'll be a good change. Give it time. You'll see.
:'''Scootaloo''': The only thing I see... is the end of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! [sniffling]

:[gavel pounding]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [sniffles] I now call our last ever Cutie Mark Crusader meeting to order. First item of business... [sobbing] CRY!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [crying]
:[pounding]
:'''Scootaloo''': You can't let the blank flanks down just 'cause I'm gone. You got to keep being CMCs without me.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [sniffles] How?! There's only two of us!
:'''Scootaloo''': [sobbing] Maybe you can find a replacement for me.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': ''No, we can't!'' You're the only... you!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [sobbing] Nothin's gonna be the same! Who's gonna ride their scooter ahead of us everywhere we go?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [sobbing] Or... Or put on plays with us? Or go camping with us? Or just hang out with us?!
:'''Scootaloo''': [sobbing] Well, it's worse for me! I have to say goodbye to both of—!
:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Guess who just got three front-row tickets to the Wonderbolts show next week!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [whine, bawling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, that is not the reaction I was expecting.
:'''Scootaloo''': [sniffles] Thanks for the tickets, Rainbow Dash. But I can't go.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Her parents are makin' her move super far away from Ponyville.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?! No way! Scootaloo belongs here!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [sobbing] And now we'll probably never see her again! It's hopeless!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [crying]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa, whoa, whoa. I cannot believe you're giving up so easily. You're the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Solving tough problems is what you do.
:'''Scootaloo''': [sniffles] We ''are'' pretty good at coming up with ideas.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That's right. When we work together, we're unstoppable!
:'''Apple Bloom''': I can't believe we didn't think of it before. It's list time, y'all! First question – why do Scootaloo's parents want to move to Shire Lanka?
:'''Scootaloo''': That's where their new job is.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [gasps] What if we get them a job here instead?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Yeah! They like dangerous creatures, right? We got to have some of those around here. Like, uh, Timberwolves!
:'''Scootaloo''': Dad knows all about those. And cockatrices and bugbears. They only study super rare animals.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Then maybe we need to give them an animal nopony's ever heard of!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Uh, then how would ''we'' hear about it?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Because we're making it up! Come on!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sooooo... you want these tickets, or...?

:[leaves rustling]
:'''Scootaloo''': This is what I wanted to show you. The tracks of the mysterious Everfree banshee beast!
:'''Mane Allgood''': Hmmm... They're like nothing I've ever seen.
:'''Scootaloo''': Legend says it has five claws and three wings. And it's suuuuper dangerous if you get close. If only somepony could prove it exists.
:'''Snap Shutter''': Hmmm... Easy enough. We'll follow the spoor.
:'''Scootaloo''': [panicked whimpering] I think I heard something ''this'' way.
:[leaves rustling]
:[camera clicks]
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': [grunting]
:'''Apple Bloom''': So the plan is we let 'em get a picture, then we hide again. Right?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [straining]
:[twig snaps]
:[camera clicks]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Now the plan is... run!
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': [panting]
:[snap!]
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': Aah! Oof!
:'''Scootaloo''': [nervous laugh] Guess you solved the mystery.
:'''Mane Allgood''': We'd better get back. There's a lot to get ready before the house goes up for sale tomorrow.
:'''Scootaloo''': [whines]

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Don't worry, Scootaloo. We have a new plan to keep you in Ponyville.
:'''Apple Bloom''': We just got to show your parents we're a set of three. Then they'll have to let you stay here with us.
:[camera clicks]

:'''Snap Shutter''': Scoot, are these yours?
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah. Thanks, Dad. We're sending them to the Pony Book of Records.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We're the only three ponies in Equestria with the same cutie mark.
:'''Apple Bloom''': The chances of that are so rare. It means we belong together forever.
:'''Snap Shutter''': Yeah, but you don't have the same cutie mark.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [short laugh] Sure we do. Look!
:'''Snap Shutter''': Well, this part is the same. But the picture inside each of these is different. I think it means you'll stay best friends no matter where you go, and that's really special.
:'''Scootaloo''': But... we... [sighs] How do you argue with that?

:'''Scootaloo''': [sighs]
:[door opens]
:'''Apple Bloom''': All right, y'all. Time to take things up a notch.
:'''Scootaloo''': With prune juice?
:'''Apple Bloom''': It's a potion I mixed up from Zecora's book. Prune is only one of the ingredients.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': What's it do?
:'''Apple Bloom''': [reading] "On this potion, please depend. Any separation, mend. Friends together 'til the end." We just got to dab a little on our hooves. Sounds perfect, right?
:'''Scootaloo''': Better than perfect!
:[drops splash]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Is something supposed to happen?
:[magic sounds]
:[snap!]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Is ''this'' the something that's supposed to happen?!
:'''Apple Bloom''': The book didn't really say.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Whoa... W-Whoa... Whoa! [grunt]
:'''Scootaloo''': Thanks for trying, Apple Bloom. But I might as well face it. I'm gonna have to leave Ponyville.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Don't give up, Scootaloo. This just gave me an even better idea how to keep you here. Come on!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Whoa! [grunt]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Maybe we'd better see Zecora about fixing this first.

:'''Scootaloo''': We're running out of time.
:[chains jangling]
:'''Scootaloo''': This has to work!
:[door opens]
:'''Mane Allgood''': Scootaloo, I know you're having fun with your friends, but we need to get all our things to the station.
:'''Snap Shutter''': We can't miss tomorrow's train. It's the only one for a month.
:'''Scootaloo''': Then you'll just have to go without me! I'm staying with the CMCs!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We're chained to this post!
:'''Apple Bloom''': And nothin' and nopony is gonna move us! No matter... what.
:'''Snap Shutter''': We just sold the house, Scoot. I know this is hard to accept, but just—
:'''Scootaloo''': It's more than hard! It's not fair! You're making me pick between my family and my friends!
:'''Mane Allgood''': Oh, Scootaloo. Moving away won't stop you three from caring about each other. Why don't you sleep over with Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom tonight? It'll give you a chance to say a real goodbye.
:'''Scootaloo''': But I don't ''want'' to say goodbye! You're changing my whole life without even asking how I feel! [crying]

:'''Apple Bloom''': [panting] Scootaloo!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Where are you going?
:'''Scootaloo''': To stay with my aunts. [tearing up] You heard my parents. There isn't another train to Shire Lanka for a month. If I'm not on it, they'll have to go without me.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Then we're comin' with ya!
:'''Scootaloo''': Are you sure? I don't want to get you in trouble.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Rarity won't be mad.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Applejack neither. I bet she'd do the same thing for ''her'' friends.
:'''Scootaloo''': You're the best, you know that?
:'''Apple Bloom''': ''We're'' the best.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Together!
:[train whistle blows]
:[brakes hiss]
:[train chugging]

:[knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Aunt Holiday''': [gasps] Scootaloo! What a nice surprise.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': And ''I've'' got a surprise for ''you''! You three inspired me to finish my quilt. See? It's Cutie Mark Crusader-themed!
:'''Aunt Holiday''': We love hearing stories about all the ponies you've helped. So Lofty decided to celebrate the special job you three do.
:'''Scootaloo''': [sighs]
:'''Auntie Lofty''': It's... still a work-in-progress.
:'''Scootaloo''': It's not your quilt we're sad about, Auntie Lofty. Mom and Dad are back. And they're making me move to Shire Lanka with them!
:'''Aunt Holiday''': Snap and Mane are back? They didn't tell me that.
:'''Scootaloo''': Oh. I think the mailpony delivered your letter to my house. I love my family, but I love being with my friends, too. I don't want to have to choose.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': Well, then why don't your parents just stay in Ponyville?
:'''Scootaloo''': Their job is too important.
:'''Apple Bloom''': That's it!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Is this another potion idea?
:'''Apple Bloom''': No. Scootaloo's parents are the only ponies in Equestria that can do what they do, right?
:'''Scootaloo''': Right...
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, so are we! Our cutie marks prove it!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Yeah... Our job is to help other ponies find their purpose!
:'''Scootaloo''': And nopony else can do that! So if my parents split us up, it'd be just as bad as them quitting ''their'' jobs!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Woo-hoo! [laughing]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Now, how do we explain that to 'em?
:'''Aunt Holiday''': Oh, ''you'' don't have to explain it.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': ''They'' will.

:'''Mane Allgood''': Feeling better, Scootaloo?
:'''Scootaloo''': A little. I just want to show you something before we go.
:'''Snap Shutter''': All right, but let's make it swift. That train won't wait.

:'''Snap Shutter''': Sweet Celestia's slippers!
:'''Mane Allgood''': What is all this?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's Cutie Mark Crusader Appreciation Day! But we couldn't start without ''all'' of them here.
:'''Ponies''': CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs!
:'''Mayor Mare''': These three ponies share a rare ability to help others find their true purpose. It's a job only they can do, and only together.
:'''Mane Allgood''': That sounds familiar.
:'''Mayor Mare''': In honor of all they have done and continue to do for the ponies of this town, I would like to present the Cutie Mark Crusaders with a three-handled Key to the City!
:'''Ponies''': [cheering]
:[zooming]
:'''Snap Shutter''': A full Wonderbolt salute!
:'''Aunt Holiday''': Oh, I'm not sure you know just how important Scootaloo and her friends are, little brother.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': But you're about to find out.
:'''Skeedaddle''': The CMCs used their free time to set up a camp to help us blank flanks find our cutie marks. The Cutie Mark Crusaders see the best in everypony, even when that pony can't see it in themselves.
:'''Snap Shutter''': Well, I'll be a three-tailed bandicoot. I had no idea how important Scoot's club was.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, it's ''way'' more than just a club. The CMCs have made a difference for everypony here.
:'''Terramar''': And not just ponies. They help everycreature.
:'''Aunt Holiday''': Whether it's encouraging others to discover their special talent...
:[hooves tapping]
:'''Auntie Lofty''': ...or inspiring them to do what's in their heart...
:'''Aunt Holiday''': ...these three offer the town something no other pony can.
:[train whistle blows]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No way! After all that, you're still gonna make her leave?!
:'''Mane Allgood''': We just want what's best for Scootaloo. And until now, we thought we knew what that was.
:'''Snap Shutter''': [sighs] Turns out you're just like us, Scoot. You have an important job that only you can do. You love it, and it helps all of Equestria.
:'''Mane Allgood''': Sometimes that means missing out on other things you love, like watching our daughter grow into a pony we're very proud of.
:'''Snap Shutter''': Which is a long way to say... Scoot, if you want to stay, we understand.
:'''Scootaloo''': [gasps] Really?! [tearing up] Thanks, Dad! Thanks, Mom!
:'''Mane Allgood''': Oh, sweetie, I'm just sorry we didn't realize it sooner.
:'''Snap Shutter''': Our work is our life's purpose. We could never quit. So there's no way we can ask you to do the same.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': Maybe you should've thought of that before you sold the house.
:'''Aunt Holiday''': Lofty, don't tease my brother. We already have a solution worked out.
:'''Auntie Lofty''': Since the CMCs make Ponyville such a nice place, we've decided to move here.
:'''Aunt Holiday''': You can live with us, Scootaloo. If you'd like.
:'''Scootaloo''': That would be amazing! Will you... still come and visit?
:'''Mane Allgood''': Of course!
:'''Snap Shutter''': Rabid bugbears couldn't keep us away.
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': You get to stay here! You get to stay here! You get to stay here! [laugh]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Uh... you ''are'' stayin' here, right?
:'''Scootaloo''': Are you kidding? CMCs forever!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]
:'''Ponies''': [cheering]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Remind me how this happened again!
:[crunch]
:'''Applejack''': And why there's a giant turtle eatin' my family's entire summer crop!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, dear. Mr. Tortoise-Snap said he was hungry. But he promised me he would only take a few small bites.

:'''Princess Luna''': [laughs] Goodness, sister! That was fun!
:'''Princess Celestia''': No need to thank us. To be honest, we've recently realized we like being part of the action.
:'''Princess Luna''': Experiencing life instead of just dreaming about it.
:'''Princess Celestia''': And making a difference outside the throne room.
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [laughing]
:'''Applejack''': Y'all think they're gonna be doin' this a lot?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls] I can't read this thing. How am I supposed to lead a Filly Guides hike if the map makes us ''more'' lost?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Did somepony say "lost"?
:'''Princess Luna''': Not for long! [laughs]
:[zap!]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [slurps]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, now, this is just terrible! Miss Cheerilee ordered cupcakes for school today, and I forgot to make the order!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ah, no biggie. We could—
:[crash!]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Students going hungry? Not on our watch!
:'''Princess Luna''': Let us bake, sister!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[splattering]

:'''Applejack''': And then they carried Granny Smith across the street. There wasn't even any traffic!
:'''Fluttershy''': It's not that we don't appreciate their help.
:'''Rarity''': But suddenly, Celestia and Luna seem to think we can't do anything on our own.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How are we supposed to learn to be rulers of Equestria with them fixing every teensy problem for us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe the princesses changed their minds. Maybe they don't think we're up to the responsibility of protecting Equestria after all!
:'''Spike''': Or maybe this week's just a one-time thing that'll never happen again.
:[doors open]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Ah! A strategy meeting! What is the danger this time? A rampaging beast? Evil spell? Friendship problem?
:'''Princess Luna''': We're ready to do whatever we can.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great. But is something wrong? It's just... You've been helping us an awful lot, and we know you have way more important ruler-y things to do, so...
:'''Princess Luna''': We've spent more than enough time in the throne room. Real life is happening out here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait. That's what this is about? You're sick of being princesses?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Not exactly. Battling the Everfree Forest alongside Star Swirl made us realize what we've missed out on. So, instead of spending the day ruling...
:'''Princess Luna''': ...and the night patrolling dreams...
:'''Princess Celestia''': ...we wanted a chance to do the things ''you'' do. Save the day! Adventure with friends! Shampoo anteaters.
:'''Spike''': I'm pretty sure Fluttershy's the only pony that does that.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, there are waaaay more fun things to do than follow us around.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! You should make a list of all the stuff you never tried but always wanted to! There's a lotta little things out there to do!
:'''Princess Celestia''': What an intriguing idea. Only... it's much harder to justify a vacation from the castle when it's not an emergency we're responding to.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't worry. We'll cover your palace duties. It'll be a good chance for us to practice for when you retire.
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, if you're sure you don't mind the extra effort.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [scoffs]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Thank you, Twilight! What a relief to know the Royal Swanifying Ceremony is in good hooves. [laughs]
:'''Applejack''': The what now?

:'''Princess Celestia''': "Fun Not Yet Had". [squeals] I can't wait to start planning our time off!
:'''Princess Luna''': The chance to do whatever we want! And you know what that means!
{|
|
:'''Princess Celestia''':
:Adventure!
|
:'''Princess Luna''':
:Relaxation!
|}
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, it's just that I... I spend each night in everypony's intense dreams. So I could use some real-world downtime.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [sighs] I understand. But for me, every day ''is'' real-world. Meetings and decrees and meetings about decrees and decrees about the meetings... I crave excitement!
:'''Princess Luna''': Uh, I'm not sure how we can both be happy. Unless...
:'''Princess Celestia''': [gasps] We take turns doing what we like!
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': Sister trip!
:'''Princess Luna''': And I have the perfect accessories for us to wear! Wait right here!
:[teleportation zap]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh. [nervous laugh] We'll be... twin-sies.
:'''Princess Luna''': [giggling] Just like regular pony tourists. I knew you'd love it.
:'''Princess Celestia''': I have a few things for us, too.
:[thud]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Sunglasses, bug spray, ice boots, hoof sanitizer, and travel snacks!
:'''Princess Luna''': [slurps, chews, coughs]
:'''Princess Celestia''': You have to add water. What do you think?
:'''Princess Luna''': It's perfect, sister.

:'''Princess Celestia''': And here are instructions of how to prepare for the Royal Swanifying.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If it's written down, I'm sure we can handle it. Have fun!
:'''Princess Luna''': One more thing. We're leaving you in charge of raising the sun and moon while we're gone.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh]
:'''Princess Celestia''': We have put a small part of our power in this amulet. You can activate it with your magic at any time. Preferably dawn and dusk.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! That's not a terrifying level of responsibility or anything!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We won't let you down, princesses. [to Spike] Please tell me that scroll says what the the Royal Swanifying is.
:'''Spike''': Apparently it's a celebration of all the swans in the royal lake. We round them up, parade them through the streets, and finish with a party in the castle.
:[swan squawks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': One question. ''Why?!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It doesn't matter. This is our chance to show Celestia and Luna we'll do whatever the job requires. If they can take care of all this themselves, then I know ''we'' can. Together.
:'''Fluttershy''': Um... hmm.
:'''Rarity''': Ah. Jolly good.
:'''Spike''': You're definitely not reading the same scroll I am.

:'''Princess Celestia''': Remember, sister. From now on, we are regular, carefree ponies!
:[excited chattering]
:[camera clicks]
:'''Princess Luna''': We're leaving the princess life behind, and we're not even going to fly!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Of course. [laughs] How new and different. It's just like Pinkie Pie said.
{{#lst:Lotta Little Things|song}}
:[doors open]
:'''Fancy Pants''': Princesses, we are here to... Oh.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, we're fillin' in for Their Majesties. What can we help y'all with?
:'''Fancy Pants''': I say. How irregular. Well then. We offer our assistance as heads of the Royal Swanifying Committee.
:'''Rarity''': Ah, what a relief.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you, but we have it all covered.
:'''Fancy Pants''': Reeeeeally? Well, good luck with that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If we ask for help, it's just like admitting we're not as good at the job as Luna and Celestia are. Besides, how hard can throwing a swan party be?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! All we have left to do is polish the armor, bubble the punch, glitter the carpet, puff the pastry, float the floats, and carpet every road in Canterlot! Should I keep reading?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh]

:'''Princess Luna''': Uh, Celestia? Since we're both a little tired, m-maybe the first thing we do shouldn't be too wild.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Exactly what I was thinking.

:'''Princess Celestia''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">ziiiiip liiiiiiiiiine!</span>''

:'''Princess Celestia''': Now, every time we have tea, we can remember this magical day!
:'''Princess Luna''': Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. But now, we're going to do something ''I've'' always wanted to do but never could because of my night shift.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Is it another zip line?
:'''Princess Luna''': No.

:'''Princess Luna''': It's the post office!
:'''Princess Celestia''': It is indeed.
:'''Princess Luna''': Just think! All the mail in Ponyville goes through here! Isn't that amazing?!
:[thump]
:'''Princess Luna''': One stamp, please!
:[clattering]
:'''Princess Luna''': [licks] Wait for it...
:[watch ticking]
:[door opens]
:'''Princess Celestia''': You didn't need a stamp if you were just going to give this to me.
:'''Princess Luna''': Yes, but ''I'' didn't give it to you. A mailpony took it from me, searched to find who it was meant for, and gave it to you! It's about the process!

:'''Princess Celestia''': [echoing] Did you know that nopony has ever explored the bottom of these caverns?
:[roaring]
:[rocks crunching]
:'''Princess Luna''': [flatly] I wonder why.

:'''Princess Luna''': I have always wanted to try this!
:[technopop]
:'''Princess Luna''': Isn't this wonderful, sister?
{{#lst:Lotta Little Things|reprise}}
:[inflating sounds]
:[doors open]
:'''Fancy Pants''': Princess Twilight! It has come to our attention that you don't intend to serve watercress at the Royal Swanifying Ceremony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There's not enough in the castle kitchens to—
:'''Fancy Pants''': Don't tell ''me''. Tell ''him''.
:[swan squawks]
:'''Fancy Pants''': And you must do something about the garbage piling up outside. The street sweepers are on strike, and the royal carpeters can't do their jobs.
:'''Applejack''': Did you even know there were royal street carpeters?
:'''Fancy Pants''': Oh, dear. I do hope those aren't the final decorations for the gala.
:'''Rarity''': How rude.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you for your constructive criticism. But we really don't have time to chat, so...
:[doors close]

:'''Princess Celestia''': [chewing, gulps] Well, I hope ''you're'' enjoying yourself on your super-relaxing picnic, sister.
:'''Princess Luna''': I would be if you hadn't made us hike through a million prickle bushes! [groans]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Well, they hurt less than that horrible howling you dragged us to.
:'''Princess Luna''': That was ''Ponygliacci'', and it's an opera! And you made us leave early, even though it was still ''my'' turn.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, just face it, Luna. You are never happy!
:'''Princess Luna''': Because you don't want me to be happy. I always have to do things ''your'' way. I bet you wish I'd never come back so you could still rule day ''and'' night!
:'''Princess Celestia''': You think I ''like'' that kind of pressure?! Being responsible for every little thing in Equestria ''and'' you?! What I'd like is a [booming] ''sister I can depend on!''
:'''Princess Luna''': [booming] ''You mean boss around!''
:'''Princess Celestia''': [booming] ''Calm down, Luna!''
:'''Princess Luna''': No! And don't you ''dare'' use your Canterlot Voice on me! I think this adventure would be better if I did it by myself!
:'''Princess Celestia''': ''Fine!'' I just remembered something I forgot I always wanted to do. Be alone!
:'''Princess Luna''': [tearing up] Guess we have the same thing on both of our lists then.

:'''Applejack''': Pinkie! You got those appetizers yet?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Still mashing the guacamole!
:'''Spike''': [yelping]
:'''Rarity''': So we're just going to have to do with sequins!
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, sorry for the bad news, but the courtyard is full of swans waiting to get in!
:[swans squawking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And we're nowhere near ready!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How does Celestia and Luna rule a kingdom ''and'' get all this done by themselves every year?!
:'''Fancy Pants''': [laughs] Oh, how droll.
:'''Spike''': Uh, what's the funny part exactly?
:'''Fancy Pants''': The princesses never do all the ceremony planning by themselves.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They don't?
:'''Fancy Pants''': Oh, goodness, no. That's what the gala planning committees are for. Nopony could handle all this. [sips] Are those... sequins?
:'''Rarity''': Still rude.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! New plan, everypony! We're going to delegate!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [to Upper Crust] You! You're on food duty!
:'''Rarity''': [to Jet Set] I need gemstones! And purple satin!
:'''Fluttershy''': [to Fleur de Lis] Tell the ponies at the gates there's a slight delay on the gala! Oh, um, if it's not too much trouble, I mean.
:'''Applejack''': Uh... Now, who can we get to clean up all this garbage?
:[stomping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm delegating!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So ''this'' is how you rule Equestria!

:'''Princess Luna''': [slurping, sighs] Things are so much more relaxing without my bossy sister.
:[ponies laughing]

:'''Princess Celestia''': Who needs a gloomy sister moping around all the time anyway? [whinnies]

:'''Princess Luna''': [groans]
:'''"Nurse Sweetheart"''': Honestly, princess, didn't you wear any sunblock?
:'''Princess Luna''': That's a thing? [sighs] Celestia would've warned me. If she were here.

:'''Princess Celestia''': Now, was it two left turns and a right, or two right turns and a left?
:[whoosh!]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Luna always handled directions.
:[twig snaps]
:[chicken clucks]
:'''Princess Celestia''': [shakily] And scared away the chickens!

:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh! Heh. I thought climbing Mount Filly-mane-jaro was on ''my'' list.
:'''Princess Luna''': I'm not copying you! I just wanted to watch the sunrise.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Ah. I'm, uh, here for the moonset.
:[beat]
:'''Princess Celestia''': So, uh, how did the rest of your day go?
:'''Princess Luna''': Oh, amazing! Yeah. Uh, f-fantastic. Best ever, really.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Yeah. Me... too. Mmm.
:'''Princess Luna''': You... You can walk with me. You know, i-if you want, I mean.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, well... [scoffs] Since we're going the same way. [laughs]

:'''Princess Luna''': This is so beautiful. It must be amazing in the sunlight.
:'''Princess Celestia''': The night's pretty special, too.
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': Lucky star!
:'''Princess Luna''': You taught me to look for those when I was a filly.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [laughs] Hope I wasn't too bossy doing it.
:'''Princess Luna''': You know, being with your sister all the time is hard, but being without her? It's even harder.
:'''Princess Celestia''': I ''do'' know. [sighs] And I wouldn't trade you for any of the adventures on my list.
:'''Princess Luna''': Not even your zip line?
:[poof!]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Not even my zip line.
:'''Princess Luna''': I'm sorry I said those things before. Sometimes it's just tough being the little sister.
:'''Princess Celestia''': It's not always easy being the big sister either. I'm sorry, too.
:'''Princess Luna''': [gasps] The sun and the moon together? At the same time?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Now, where have I seen ''that'' before?
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [laugh]
:[long pause]
:'''Princess Celestia''': You think maybe Twilight's having trouble with the amulet?
:'''Princess Luna''': We should probably go help her.

:'''Spike''': Okay, okay! I think I got it! Sunburst says we just need to reset the amulet with this! Turn the screw on the back—
:[cranking]
:[sproing!]
:'''Spike''': ...and no more than one half turn.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpers] Does anypony have some tape?!

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:[whoosh!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I thought Pinkie Pie said to get here right away.
:'''Applejack''': She sure had a burr in her britches about somethin'.
:'''Spike''': So where is she?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scoffs] Yeah. What is taking her so long? [giggles] Just kidding. You guys really need to look behind you once in a while.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Pinkie? You said you had something important to tell us.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Not telling so much as showing. In fact, what you're about to see may shake the very foundations of your perception for all time!
:'''Fluttershy''': Um... a cupcake?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yes! But wait, there's more!
:[click]
:[squeak!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's an invitation to visit the Cheese Sandwich Amusement Factory!
:'''Spike''': Cheese Sandwich opened a factory?
:'''Applejack''': Heh. What do they make there? Rubber chickens?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's ridiculous! They make way more there than just rubber chickens! [giggles]
:'''Rarity''': Gosh, Cheese hardly seems the factory type. I just assumed he'd continue to wander Equestria throwing parties. Still, you must be excited to see him.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I am! I can't wait to tour his factory, catch up, have him tell me my life's purpose, swap gag tips—
:'''Applejack''': Whoa-whoa-whoa. What did you say?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh, catch up? I mean, it has been a while.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think Applejack's asking about the part about Cheese Sandwich and your life's purpose.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, that. Yeah. It's just... All of you have found your thing. You're gonna rule all of Equestria, Rainbow Dash is a Wonderbolt, Fluttershy has her animal sanctuary, Rarity has her boutiques, Applejack has the hat... And the farm! So that's like... two things! I don't even have ''one''. [sighs, chomps] When I first got Cheese's invite, I was a little jealous. It felt like even he was moving on to bigger and better things. And everypony was leaving me behind. But then I realized Cheese Sandwich is a party pony just like me. If he figured out his purpose, he can help me figure out mine.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think talking to Cheese Sandwich is a great idea. But the only pony who can really find your life's purpose is ''you''.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know, silly. That's why ''I'm'' going to visit Cheese Sandwich's factory so ''I'' can ask him to help ''me''. [chomps]
:'''Spike''': Uh, Pinkie? Are you sure this is edible?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I am not! [chomps]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[bouncing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yup! Anypony with a smile like that is exactly the kind of pony I want helping me!
:[bouncing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, hey, guys! Pardon me? Just gonna... squeeze by? [straining]
:'''Guard Pony 1''': Can we help you?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You sure can! I'm here to see Cheese Sandwich!
:'''Guard Pony 2''': Cheese Sandwich doesn't "see" anypony.
:'''Guard Pony 1''': This factory's shut tight. Nopony ever comes out, and nopony ever goes in. Including you. So move along.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aw, that's a shame. To think I came all this way because of this personal invitation from Cheese Sandwich himself.
:'''Guard Pony 2''': You... You have an invitation?
:'''Guard Pony 1''': Well, why didn't you say so?
:[alarm]
:[clang!]
:'''Guard Pony 2''': Next time, ''I'' get to push the button.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! Desolate-y! Hello? Anypony there?
:[doors open]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [yelps] Cheese! I'm so happy to see you! [strains]
:[stretch]
:[whip!]
:'''Sans Smirk''': Hmm. This should have gotten a big laugh. I wonder if we need to add more carpet rolls. I suppose it could be the mask. Let's try taking the nostril flare down ten percent. Thoughts?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I have a thought. Who are you?
:'''Sans Smirk''': So sorry. Sans Smirk, vice-president of amusement integration. Mr. Sandwich is very excited you're here. If you'll just follow me, it's a short trip through the factory to Cheese's office.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow! A whole factory dedicated to gags! Ooh! I bet this is the funnest place ever!
:[doors open]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh.
:[industrial sounds]
:[conveyor belt whirring]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe the fun is behind all this boring-looking factory stuff.
:[thud]
:[pop!]
:[thunk!]
:'''Sans Smirk''': The fun ''is'' the factory stuff. We take a fairly serious approach to comedy here. Observe. [stilted] Oh, look. A pretty flower. [sniffs]
:[squirt]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The squirting flower's a classic. Ohhh! What if the flower was part of a shirt, but the flower didn't squirt – the shirt did?!
:'''Sans Smirk''': That is literally the funniest thing I've ever heard.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, [giggles] come on. That's just off the top of my head. You probably get, like, seventeen thousand ideas like that from Cheese every minute.
:'''Sans Smirk''': We'd have to use a series of interconnected tubes in the fabric. What do you think of this?
:[flatulence]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I think it's a whoopee cushion.
:'''Sans Smirk''': Yes...?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But what if you made the embarrassing sound come from somepony else?!
:'''Sans Smirk''': I sit on it, but the sound comes from ''you''... We could call it the "ventriloquoopee cushion".
:[factory ponies agreeing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': So... which way is Cheese's office again?
:'''Sans Smirk''': Right. Of course. It's been quite a while since we've had the opportunity to work with true comic inspiration like this.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What about Cheese?
:'''Sans Smirk''': Oh! One more thing. Our super-slip banana peel. Still in development, but we think it's pretty special.
:[splattering sounds]
:[factory ponies yelping]
:'''Sans Smirk''': So? Too slippery?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ohhh-ho-ho. What if, instead of slipping, you were sticking? One step on this banana peel, and you can't get it off! [giggles] ''That's'' funny!
:'''Sans Smirk''': Wow. Just... wow. You're exactly the pony Cheese Sandwich needs to see.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Great! Because ''he's'' exactly the pony ''I'' need to see!
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh... hello?
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [grimly] Pinkie, I'm... I'm glad you came.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Of course I did. Your factory's... big. It really seems like you found your purpose. Which is perfect, since I came here for help.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': That is perfect. I knew I could count on you to help me.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, that's triple-perfect, because... uh, wait. Why do you need ''my'' help?
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Because, Pinkie, I... [claps]
:[ka-chunk]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': ...I completely lost my laugh!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': You lost your laugh? Is that some kind of joke? Because it's not a funny one.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': It's not a joke. And even if it was, I... I wouldn't be able to laugh at it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Riiiiight... Why don't we continue this discussion over some delicious canned peanut brittle, hmm? [laughs]
:[sproing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow. You ''did'' lose your laugh. That's horrible!
:'''Sans Smirk''': Sorry to interrupt, but it occurs to me that a seven percent tighter wind on the snake springs would yield a twelve percent increase in giggle output.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': This is why we're a team. Sans here has always been able to eke every last laugh out of my gags. W-Which is a help, since I haven't come up with any good ones in a while.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait. So you can tell if a gag is funny is not – you just can't laugh at it?
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [tearing up] Yes! And it's torture!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How did this happen?
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': I don't know. Back when I was a party pony, I... I laughed at everything.

:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [voiceover] I spread my party cheer wherever it was needed. I even started making individual, one-of-a-kind novelty gags for each and every one of my parties.
:[whack! whack! whack!]
:[foals laughing]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [laughing]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [voiceover] Soon, it seemed like everypony in Equestria wanted one.
:[excited sounds]

:[buzzing]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [laughs]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [voiceover] It was more work than my hooves could handle, but I didn't want to disappoint all those smiling faces.
:[door opens]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [voiceover] Luckily, Sans Smirk came to me with the idea for a factory. A gag factory. I could finally keep up with demand and make everypony happy. Soon we were sending gags all over Equestria.
:[conveyor belt whirs]
:[flatulence]
:[conveyor belt whirs]
:[crank]
:[ribbit!]
:[conveyor belt whirs]
:[squirt]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [voiceover] But then, one day, my laugh was just... gone.

:'''Cheese Sandwich''': I haven't left the factory since. I-I don't want anypony to see me like this. I-I mean, look at me! Boneless 2 doesn't even recognize me anymore!
:[chair creaks]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': So, can you help me, Pinkie? W-What do you think?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I think I've got two words for you. Knock... knock.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Who's there?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Boo.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Boo who?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't cry, because I'm gonna get you your laugh back!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's start with something small. Excuse me, Mr. Smirk. But is there something in my... eye?!
:[rattling]
:'''Sans Smirk''': Top notch eye-googling, Ms. Pie.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Why, thanks, Sans, ol' pal. Put her there!
:[buzzing]
:'''Sans Smirk''': [groaning]
:[sizzle]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. Sorry about that. Let me make it up to you. How about some... pie?
:[splat!]
:'''Sans Smirk''': Googly eye to hoof buzzer to pie-face pratfall. Mwah! Masterful.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Meh.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Come on! Those classic bits put Rainbow Dash's funny bone in a cast for a week!
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Don't blame yourself, Pinkie. Whatever I got, I got it bad.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmmm... Maybe we need to start even smaller.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': You can't run before you can walk, and you can't laugh before you can smile. And your smiler's all out of whack. Now let's see what we're working with. Give me your biggest, bestest smile!
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [straining] Am I doing it? Am I smiling? I feel like I'm smiling.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Almost... [laughing nervously] Maybe I just need to spot you for a rep or two. [straining] Okay! You got this! It's all you! Ready?
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Anything?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Awww...
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Guh.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm not giving up on you yet, Cheese. I know there's something somewhere that'll make you laugh. I just have to figure out where to look.
:'''Sans Smirk''': I would like to take this opportunity to point out that we ''are'' in a gag factory.

:[door opens]
:'''Sans Smirk''': This is where the magic happens – research and development. It's where we figure out the science of funny.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How do you science funny?
:'''Sans Smirk''': Of course there's no one-size-fits-all joke. No grand unified gag theory. But if we figure out the funny of one gag, we can combine it with the funny of another gag and make a third funnier gag.
:[sproing]
:[splat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I... guess that makes sense. "Rule of threes". Hmmm. One, two, three. Yup. That math checks out. Hmmm. At this point, I'm willing to give anything a try.

:[montage music]
:[awestruck sounds]
:[door closes]
:[clang!]
:[splash!]
:["uh-uh", "nope", etc.]

:[squirt]
:[pop-pop-pop]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans] I don't understand! We've tried everything! Stand-up, classic gag, physical humor, prop comedy, vaudeville, surrealist alt-scene character pieces – nothing's worked!
:'''Sans Smirk''': It seems we've exhausted every avenue that even the science of comedy can provide.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': That's it then.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What do you mean?
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': [sighs] I appreciate everything you've done, Pinkie, but if ''you'' can't make me laugh, nopony can.
:'''Sans Smirk''': But, sir, you can't just surrender.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': It doesn't look like I have a choice. I need to figure out how to live without a laugh. I know you tried your best, but it's time you went home.
:[doors open]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:'''Sans Smirk''': I, too, am horrified.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': So that's it? You're all just giving up?
:'''Sans Smirk''': I'm afraid Mr. Sandwich is right. You are the funniest pony in Equestria. And if you can't bring back his laugh, it is surely gone forever.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But... Cheese was just as funny as me. I-I can't believe that's all gone.
:[doors open]
:'''Sans Smirk''': None of us can. I shudder to think what'll become of the factory.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're not gonna close down, are you? I thought this place was Cheese's life's purpose!
:'''Sans Smirk''': It certainly was mine. But if Mr. Sandwich has finally given up, there's only so long we can retool his old ideas before we run out of gags to produce. I don't suppose... ''you'd'' consider working here? Your fresh take on our classic gags rivals Mr. Sandwich in his prime.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I need to find my life's purpose, but I don't think that's it. I'm a party pony! I need to make ponies happy in real-time!
:'''Sans Smirk''': Ah, yes. In our early days, nothing brought Mr. Sandwich more pleasure than seeing the laughter his gags brought to ponies firsthoof.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Guess it's back to the drawing board.
:'''Sans Smirk''': Well, there will always be a place for you here if you change your mind.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hold on. What did you just say?
:'''Sans Smirk''': There'll always be a place for you here?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No-no-no-no. Before that.
:'''Sans Smirk''': Back to the drawing board.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans] That was me!
:'''Sans Smirk''': Nothing brought Mr. Sandwich more pleasure than seeing the laughter his gags brought to ponies firsthoof?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yes! That! We've been going about this all wrong! We don't need to make Cheese laugh. ''He'' needs to make ''us'' laugh!
:[zip!]

:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Cheese! I figured it out! I know why you can't laugh!
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': What? Why?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You started this factory because you didn't want to disappoint smiling faces. But in here, you can't see any.
:'''Sans Smirk''': [panting] It does make a certain sense, sir. Spreading laughter has always brought you joy.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': But spreading laughter is what this factory does.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Except you don't ''see'' it. You're a party pony like me. You need to make ponies smile in-person! Here. Just try it.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Okay... um... [clears throat] Why did Boneless 2 cross the road? To prove to Boneless 1 he wasn't a chicken.
:'''Sans Smirk''': Very funny, sir. Excellent joke. Oh! I mean... [forced laughter]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Really?
:'''Sans Smirk''': Sorry. Not much of a laugher.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Here. Try me. I promise I'll laugh.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Pinkie, you laugh at everything. I appreciate what you're doing, but I think it's a "cost lause". [stutters] A lost cause.
:'''Factory Pony''': [snickers]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': What... was... that?!
:'''Factory Pony''': Um, I'm sorry. When you swapped the letters of those words, it was just a bit...
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Funny?
:'''Factory Pony''': Uh-huh.
{{#lst:The Last Laugh (song)|song}}
:[factory ponies laughing]
:'''Sans Smirk''': It's so good to have you back, sir. Finally we can get the factory back to how things used to be.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Sans, my good pony, I don't think I could run this factory anymore. But you can!
:'''Sans Smirk''': Without you? I-I don't understand.
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Pinkie was right. ''This'' is what I need.
:[factory ponies laughing]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': I just can't have funny ideas. I need to wander the land and see ponies laughing at them. You can run the factory, but I need to [operatically] liiiiiive! And don't think I've forgotten about you, little buddy.
:[chair creaks]
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': I knew you'd be onboard. Don't worry. Out in Equestria, I'll have more great ideas for gags, and I'll send them all to you.
:'''Sans Smirk''': Sir, are you sure this is what you want to do?
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': Of course. It's my life's purpose!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey! That's what I came here looking for!
:'''Cheese Sandwich''': You did? Well, come on! Let's figure it out!
:[factory ponies laughing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Actually, I think I'm good.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...And then I said goodbye, and then I came here! Oh! And then I gathered you all together and started telling you about it. First, I said—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, that sounds like quite a trip!
:'''Fluttershy''': And Cheese Sandwich just left his own factory?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yup. But I think Sans Smirk's hooves were the perfect ones to leave it in. As much as Cheese was born to wander Equestria and make ponies laugh in-person, Sans was born to run that factory.
:'''Applejack''': And you don't sound so worried about findin' your life's purpose anymore.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nope! I figured out Cheese and I are pretty much the same. We both need to see ponies laughing to feel fulfilled. And I already do that. My life is purposing itself all over the place!
:'''Rarity''': [giggles] I agree completely.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Thanks. Oh! I almost forgot! I got you all a little something from my trip. Who likes peanut brittle?
:[boom!]
:[squeak!]
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]

:[bird chirping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I have to admit I was a little shocked when Princess Celestia told me she wanted to start a scholastic buckball league. But I was even ''more'' surprised that she wanted the first game to be between her school and ours! Apparently, she's a huge sports fan.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Always thought Celestia was kind of a jock, just with really wavy hair.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Anyway, we don't have much time. The game is in two weeks, and I want all of you to coach the team!
:[excited chattering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [hyperventilating]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know how you feel. Young athletes ready to take the field. Ooh, you could almost breathe in the excitement!
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Snails''': I don't think you should breathe it in so hard.
:[splash!]
:'''Fluttershy''': It's just... Two weeks doesn't feel like a whole lot of time to train a whole team.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmmmaybe the School of Magic could play a few other schools first. Like the Mane and Tail Styling College or the Scroll-Making Institute?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Relax. You're gonna do just fine.
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, [gasps] what makes you so sure?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Because I have faith in my friends, who also happen to be the best buckball players in Equestria!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, yeah!
:[squeaks]
:[music]
:[smack!]
:[whoosh!]
:'''Fluttershy''': I guess that ''is'' sort of true.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I asked Rainbow Dash to help, too. But I'm not sure when she—
:[whooshes]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sorry I'm late! But when Twilight said she needed my help with the buckball team, I figured I'd better grab every piece of coaching equipment I could find! So what should I focus on? Offense? Defense? Trick plays?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I was thinking of something even ''more'' important.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Awesome! Lay it on me. Whatever it is, I'll give it a hundred and twenty percent!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I knew I could count on your enthusiasm! That's why I want you to coach the cheer squad!
:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cheerleading?!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[music]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't mean to sound ungrateful. It's just when you said you wanted my help with something important, I thought you meant something important.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The cheer squad ''is'' important.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs hysterically] Oh. Well, sure, cheer squad is totally important to somepony who isn't me. But I'm more about ponies playing ''in'' the game, not cheering for it.
:[students laughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I mean, it's great that some ponies only want to cheer, though I don't know why they would.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm. Well, maybe this will be a good opportunity for you to find out.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Of course I've seen cheer squads before – on the sidelines – but I'm not even a hundred percent sure what they do. I'll probably just mess it up.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think you might be surprised. In fact, I'm more sure than ever that you're the perfect choice.
:'''Snips''': ''I'm'' actually one hundred and ''twenty'' percent sure. And it's a good thing, too. The cheer squad really needs you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What do you mean?
:'''Snips''': Well, I've been helping out, and let's put it this way. We've got two weeks until the big game, and... we could use two years. But that's all gonna change because you're here to save the day!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay... So why are ''you'' here?
:'''Snips''': What? A pony can't show school spirit?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You don't even go to this school.
:'''Snips''': Uh, okay. When I went to the Buckball Hall of Fame, I found out buckball souvenirs are big bits. If Twilight's team does well, I could start selling them full-time in Ponyville! So ''I'' have a vested interest, and ''you'' have an assistant coach! [blows whistle]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh.

:'''Lighthoof''' and '''Shimmy Shake''': [giggling]
:'''Lighthoof''': [valley girl accent] She's here!
:'''Shimmy Shake''': [valley girl accent] Get the lights!
::[rhythmically] Over and over and over again!
:'''[Lighthoof]'''
::[rhythmically] We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Dancing. Right. I've seen you two around school, haven't I?
:'''Shimmy Shake''': [laughs] I'm Shimmy Shake, and this is Lighthoof.
:'''Lighthoof''': And we are your lead dancers.
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I didn't know ''you'' three would be here.
:'''Yona''': [laughs] Yona want to cheer and make pony pyramid!
:[stomping]
:'''Ocellus''': And I thought this could be my chance to make an impression on everypony. You know, for something other than changing shape.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I didn't realize ''you'' were into school spirit, Smolder.
:'''Smolder''': Eh. I just came with these two. Guess they think you can make cheer squad cool or something.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't count on it.
:'''Snips''': Okay! Now that we're all here, why don't you tell us the plan? How are you gonna make us into the most awesome cheer squad ever?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Eh... I'unno.
:'''Cheer Squad''': [groan]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I mean, if you guys were an actual buckball team, I'd have ''plenty'' of ideas. But I don't know anything about cheerleading.
:'''Snips''': Oh! [laughs] Yes! Good one, coach! But Headmare Twilight picked you for the job, so I'm pretty sure you know what you're doing.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': If you say so.
:'''Snips''': [laughs] Right. Okay, gang, let's show Rainbow Dash what we've been working on, and she can take it from there.
:'''Yona''': Cheer squad can do that!
:[stomping]
:'''Lighthoof''': Yup. All we need is a little music!
:[up-tempo music playing]
:'''Shimmy Shake''': Over... and over... and over a...gain!
:[stomping]
:'''Lighthoof''': We want to dance... for each other and for all of our ''friends!''
:'''Smolder''': [unenthusiastically] Two, four, six, eight.
:'''Ocellus''': [quietly] Uh... friendship school is really... <small>great</small>.
:[stomping]
:[crash!]
:'''Smolder''': Well, that was a disaster.
:'''Shimmy Shake''': It's kind of hard to stick to our choreography when the floor is moving.
:'''Lighthoof''': [scoffs] Yeah, Yona, your stomps are a little too powerful.
:'''Yona''': Can we make pony pyramid instead?
:'''Ocellus''': Maybe we should figure out what cheers we should do first.
:'''Smolder''': [scoffs, sarcastically] Yeah, because ''that'll'' fix everything.
:'''Snips''': So, I mean, there's a few... uh, a lot of problems, but nothing you can't solve, right?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh? Oh, yeah. Listen, you guys don't have anything to worry about.
:'''Smolder''': We don't?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nope. In fact, I think what you all just did is totally fine. You guys have got this. So, uh, I'm just gonna head down to the field. Uh, great practice, everypony!
:[whoosh]
:[door slams]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh! What are you doing?
:'''Snips''': [grunting] What are ''you'' doing?! You've got to come back and coach the squad!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I watched them cheer stuff. Looked fine to me.
:'''Snips''': [grunts] Well, it's not! Do you know what'll happen if they do what they just did at the big game?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, nothing?
:'''Snips''': Uh, wrong!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ooh!
:'''Snips''': A good cheer squad gets the fans excited, which gets the team excited. But if nopony's excited, then no... pony... buys... any... souvenirs!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I think you're blowing this a little out of proportion.
:'''Snips''': Point is, if I'm going to make any bits at these games, that squad has to get better. And to do that, they need a coach.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] You know what? You're right! Why don't ''you'' do it? I mean, ''you're'' the one with a vested interest.

:'''Snails''': The trick to being a good buckball keeper is to do nothin'. Just empty your mind. Be the ball.
:'''Pizzelle''': Uh, balls don't have minds.
:'''Snails''': Exactly.
:[music]
:'''"November Rain"''': Uh, where's my blindfold?
:'''"Berry Bliss"''': My turn!
:'''Pizzelle''': I want to do that!
:'''"Berry Bliss"''': Over here!
:'''Smolder''': Why are you watching Snails' weird practice when you're supposed to be practicing with us?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles] Snails' practice is definitely weird. Uh, I thought Snips was practicing with you.
:'''Smolder''': He was.
:'''Shimmy Shake''': [sighs] Do you have any idea how hard it is to dance in this stuff?
:'''Ocellus''': [softly] Plus all these buttons jingle so much, you can't hear my cheers.
:'''Smolder''': Speaking up might help a little.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So don't dance and cheer.
:'''Yona''': Uh, then what cheer squad do?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I dunno.
:'''Smolder''': [angrily] Maybe you should! [calmly] Or whatever. You're the coach! You're supposed to come up with stuff for us to do.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay. I've got something for you to do.

:'''Snails''': Just do nothing. Empty your minds. Be the squad.
:'''Smolder''': We ''are'' the squad.
:'''Snails''': Oh, yeah.
:'''Snips''': At least helping sell my souvenirs was... something.
:'''Yona''': Yona still not understand how this make us better. Huh? Professor Dash needs to stay and coach!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] You guys asked me to come up with something, and I did.
:'''Smolder''': I don't think nothing counts.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Then I'm out of ideas.
:'''Snails''': This is the School of Friendship. If you need ideas, you should ask your friends for help.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh, fine.

:[montage music]
:[party cannon squeak]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay. Since you guys have been nagging me nonstop about this cheer stuff for, like, ever...
:'''Smolder''': It has literally been one day.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...I went around and got everything you need!
:[music]
:'''Smolder''': Uh, what're we supposed to do with hay?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Beats me, but Applejack seemed pretty sure about it. Oh, I almost forgot.
:'''Ocellus''': A rhyming dictionary?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. Zecora's a lot less helpful than you'd think. That's from the library so you can come up with cheers. Okay! Good practice!
:'''Smolder''': So, you're just leaving again?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh! Look. I talked to my friends, and they said this is the stuff you need. Wouldn't a true cheer squad be able to figure out what to do with it?
:'''Lighthoof''': But Fluttershy and Pinkie wanted us to show 'em everything we come up with tomorrow!
:'''Shimmy Shake''': They want us to get the team all excited before the big game!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, then it's a good thing I got you all this stuff. You better get to work!
:[whoosh]
:[door slams]
:'''Snips''': Don't look at me.

:[music]
:'''Fluttershy''': Good work, everypony! Let's take a break!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whistles] Yeah! [whistles] Wow! This team is really shaping up! Nice job!
:'''Fluttershy''': Thanks. I'm excited to see what ''you've'' been up to.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! I can't wait to see the cheer squad!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs hysterically] Oh. You're serious.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Woo-hoo! Go, team! This is so exciting!
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, I'm sure you've put in a lot of hard work.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How much work does cheer squad need?
:'''Snips''': Anypony want to buy an official School of Friendship cheer squad headband? Now I personally would buy them before the performance!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Fluttershy''': Huh?
:[up-tempo music playing]
:[stomping]
:'''[Shimmy Shake]'''
::Over... and over... and over again!
:[stomping continues]
:'''[Lighthoof]'''
::We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!
:'''[Smolder]'''
::[unenthusiastically] School of Friendship, rah, rah, rah
:'''[Ocellus]'''
::Let's win this game and hit the... oh, what rhymes with "rah"? Spa?
:[stomping continues]
:[record needle scratches]
:[stomping continues]
:'''Shimmy Shake''' and '''Lighthoof''': Yona!
:[creak]
:[party cannon squeak]
:'''Smolder''': [blusters]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I know I said I couldn't wait to see the cheer squad, but maybe I could've waited just a teensy bit longer.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, yeah! Nice one! Huh? What?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't know what everypony's so upset about. So it wasn't great. Cheerleading's never great. That's why everypony gets up to get a snack during it.
:'''Yona''': [bawls loudly]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What is the big deal?
:'''Shimmy Shake''': If you don't know, there's no point in us trying to explain it to you!
:'''Lighthoof''': Lead dancers, out!
:'''Shimmy Shake''' and '''Lighthoof''': Hmph!
:'''Smolder''': It's not that we were bad. It's that you didn't even want to try to help us get better!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I didn't try? What are you talking about?! I got you a party cannon! It's not my fault you couldn't figure out how to use it right.
:'''Ocellus''': [loudly] Well, you could have shown us! [sobbing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa. Ponies might actually care about cheer squad if she cheered like that all the time.
:'''Smolder''': Why would you say ponies don't care about cheer squad?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Because they don't.
:'''Smolder''': No. ''You'' don't. But they ''do''! I bet Headmare Twilight does! And you know what? I do, too! I actually got excited when I found out you were gonna be our coach! I figured if anypony can make cheer squad awesome, it's ''you''!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Me? Why?
:'''Smolder''': Because everything's ''always'' awesome with you! Or twenty percent cooler! Or whatever! You're the most enthusiastic pony in Equestria when it's something ''you'' care about. I just wish ''we'' were one of those things.
:[door opens, closes]
:'''Snips''': And it looks like my assistant cheer coach/souvenir selling business is a bust. So I'm gonna take off, unless you can think of something else for me to do.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Maybe I can.

:'''Ocellus''' and '''Yona''': [snoring]
:'''Snips''': [blows whistle]
:'''Yona''': Yaks hate loud noises!
:'''Ocellus''': Aah!
:'''Snips''': Squad meeting! Outside! ASAP!

:[new age music]
:[record needle scratches]
:'''Snips''': [blows whistle] Dance ponies, buckball field, pronto!
:[thud]

:'''Smolder''': [snoring]
:'''Snips''': [blows whistle] Hey, dragon! Get out here and join your squad!
:'''Smolder''': So, what? Is there some new button you wanna sell?
:'''Snips''': Not a button.
:[whooshes]
:'''Cheer Squad''': Ugh...
:'''Smolder''': Not this again.
:'''Lighthoof''': Sorry. We're not buying.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait! Look, I know I haven't been a great coach because I don't care about cheerleading. ''But'' all of you do, and I care about you. So I guess maybe I care about cheer squad. And a good friend reminded me that I can make anything I care about totally awesome. So from now on, I'm gonna give this thing a hundred and twenty percent, and I expect the same from you. We are gonna dance! We are gonna cheer! We're gonna make the biggest pony pyramid Equestria's ever seen! And when we're done, we're gonna make sure everypony on that field is so pumped up, they'll forget they even came to see a game!
:'''Snips''': Ah! But not so pumped up that they forget to buy a pennant or a button or a quality souvenir T-shirt.
:[beat]
:'''Snips''': What?

:[montage music]
:[stomping]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [blows whistle in time with stomping]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [blows whistle]

:[music continues]
:[hissing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughing]

:[hissing]
:[party cannon squeak]
:'''Cheer Squad''': [laughs]

:[crowd cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yahoo!
:'''Princess Celestia''': I realize the game of buckball traditionally requires an Earth pony, a Pegasus, and a unicorn, but I appreciate you allowing my students to compete.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course, and the wings and magical-dampening ring you made seem to be working really well.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Indeed, though not as well as your team. [echoing] COME ON, SCHOOL OF MAGIC!
:'''Fluttershy''': Ohhhh! The suspense is horrible! I'm the most nervous I've ever been, and that's saying something.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know how you feel!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't worry! Celestia's team might be tough, but we can still win this thing!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What? Oh, yeah, totally. But I wasn't talking about the game. Come on, come on, come on, come on!
:[cheering]
:'''Announcer''': And that's the end of the first half!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aaah! Sorry! Can't talk right now!
:'''Fluttershy''': I sure hope Dash being nervous is a good sign.
:[ponies chattering]
:[up-tempo music playing]
:[stomping]
:'''[Shimmy Shake]'''
::Over and over and over again!

:'''[Lighthoof]'''
::We'll cheer for our team 'til the ve-ry end!

:[rhythmic stomping]
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Smolder''': [blows smoke]

:'''[Ocellus]'''
::Everypony in the crowd, if you're feeling hip
::When I say "friend-", you say "-ship"!
::Friend!

:'''[Crowd]'''
::Ship!

:'''[Ocellus]'''
::Friend!

:'''[Crowd]'''
::Ship!

:'''[Ocellus]'''
::Welcome, everypony, to the halftime show
::We're the friendship squad, and we're ready to go!
::We're here to cheer and get you all excited
::If you'd like to join in, then you're all invited!

::It's a simple cheer, so don't chime in late

:'''[All]'''
::It goes two, four, six, GREAT!

:[party cannon squeak]
:[flames whooshing]
:[cheers and applause]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Not bad, right?
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Fluttershy''': They... were... awesome!
:'''Cheer Squad''': [laughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, they have a pretty decent coach.
:'''Cheer Squad''': [laughing]

:[crowd cheering]
:'''Announcer''': And that's the game. Final score — School of Magic, five; School of Friendship, four.
:'''Fluttershy''': Nice work, everyone. You can't win them all.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sometimes, that's just how the cupcake crumbles.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You guys were amazing!
:'''School of Friendship Team''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It was flawless. I can't think of any way that could've been better!
:'''Smolder''': We could have won the game.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] The game was just a sideshow. You guys were the main event!
:'''Princess Celestia''': I'm glad to see such good sportsponyship on display. Your cheer squad was an inspiration, Rainbow Dash. I'll have to start one at my school as well.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow, Rainbow Dash! It's almost like you were the perfect pony to coach cheer squad after all!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait a second. Was this one of those things where you knew the lesson I needed to learn before I learnt it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You mean like how you don't have to care about a thing other ponies like as long as you care about the ponies who like it? Nope. Don't know what you're talking about.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Nicely done.
:'''All''': [laughing]

:'''Spike''': Okay, Spike. You know you might get distracted by the stacks of books and copious charts, so remember what to say. "Twilight, I know you're in full prep mode for Trivia Trot tomorrow, but you need to get some sleep!" Huh. [laughs] Nice work. You got this.
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': [gasps] This is weird.
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': Twilight! What are you doing?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great question, Spike! And the answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...going to bed! Brains need eight hours of sleep to perform at optimum levels!
:'''Spike''': Oh. Cool. I thought I'd have to force you to go to bed since tomorrow is your chance to be the first pony to win Ponyville Trivia three times in a row. That is tomorrow, right?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...yes! Ask me another one.
:'''Spike''': Another what?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Another question! I want to stay in the zone. That way, I can sleep in the zone! Wake up in the zone! And be totally in the zone tomorrow!
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': Uh, this is a whole new level of "Twilight-ing", isn't it? Heh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is...

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...yes!
:'''Spike''': Are you okay?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...''yes!''
:'''Spike''': Well, good night, Twilight. Good luck with your brain sleep and getting that third win. [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is...
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...good night! And yes!
:'''Spike''': That wasn't a question.

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm glad you decided to come watch your first Trivia Trot, Spike. I hope the rules aren't too confusing.
:'''Spike''': Rules? Isn't trivia just asking questions and answering them?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] The Trot is a little more involved than that. Let's start with the first category of rules. [reading] "Categories. Rule one: Each category must be categorically designated and thoroughly researched in all categorical..."

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': "...participating in Trivia Trot." And that wraps up rule forty-one point six. Of course, the exception to that – rule forty-one point six A – is interesting itself because—
:'''Spike''': Oh, look! We're here!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! I can't wait to see who my partner's gonna be!
:'''Spike''': You don't get to pick your own team?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rule twenty point one six B, Spike. To keep things fair, the teams are randomly selected.
:'''Spike''': [sarcastically] Twenty point one six B. How could I forget?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And based on the regular attendees, I've charted every potential teammate's strengths and weaknesses, plus my percentage of winning with each one!
:'''Spike''': Ha! I knew there'd be a chart! Glad I'm just watching. I don't think I could handle being your teammate. What if I let you down?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] You could never let me down, Spike. But I'm glad you're watching, too. I'm going to need all the support I can get for win number three!
:[door opens]
:[indistinct conversations]
:'''Applejack''': Well, well, well, if it ain't our reignin' champ. Think you can win again this week, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Everypony here has a different area of expertise, so it really is anypony's game. But yes!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Then you better hope you get paired with me, because I am gonna rule this game!
:[door opens]
:'''Sunburst''': We'll just see about that! I didn't come all the way from the Crystal Empire to lose. And I hope you realize I have the highest percentage of correct answers, and I aim to keep it that way.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whickers] I hope ''you'' realize not every category is gonna be "Spells So Old, Not Even Star Swirl the Bearded Remembers Them".
:'''Fluttershy''': I hope there's one on fur maintenance for adorable creatures, because I've been 'brushing up'. [giggles]
:'''Angel''': [chitters angrily]
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, that was a category last week.
:'''Maud Pie''': It won't be in the game tonight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rule thirty-seven point two C. No back-to-back categories. But I think Fluttershy was joking.
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure sounded like a joke to me! [giggles] Woo-hoo!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie Pie?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Present!
:[dramatic musical sting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panicked muttering]
:'''Spike''': What's wrong, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I hadn't anticipated Pinkie Pie as a potential player! She's never played before! My chart is completely off! I have no way to predict what'll happen, and unpredictable is not good for a Trivia Trot three-peat!
:'''Spike''': Do I have to do that thing where I list all your successes as Princess of Friendship to put things into perspective and remind you this is just a game?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike! This has nothing to do with being the Princess of Friendship! And this is ''not'' just a game! This! Is! ''Trivia Trot!''
:[tapping]
:'''Granny Smith''': Okay, settle down, everypony. I'm fixin' to pick these here teams.
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] It's starting! I have to reevaluate my chart! Spike, I need you to find the part on matchups! Can you look outside?
:[teleportation zap]

:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': What'd I miss?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Granny's about to call out the fifth team. Sunburst gave me the highest chance of winning, but he's been paired with Cranky Doodle!
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': [mumbles, muttering] What? Who's that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': At least Rainbow Dash and Applejack aren't together. Team Apple-Dash is basically unstoppable.
:'''Applejack''': [growls]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And apart they'll spend all their energy trying to one-up each other, so that only helps my chances.
:'''Bulk Biceps''': ''Let's do this! Yeah!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Eh, not every team is a threat, but there aren't many ponies left.
:'''Granny Smith''': All righty, hold on to your horseshoes, 'cause the next pair of players is... Maud and Mudbriar!
:[crowd groans]
:'''Spike''': What's wrong?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maud and Mudbriar have been paired together every week. It's a statistical improbability! Which would be fine if they weren't so good.
:[sizzling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [deep gasp] Oh, no! According to my calculations, the only pony who could really threaten my winning streak is...!
:'''Granny Smith''': And our final pair of contestants for this week's Trivia Trot is... Twilight and Pinkie Pie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight! It's you and me! Isn't that great?
:[clatter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah. Great.

:'''Spike''': So, I'm guessing the one pony who could mess up your winning streak is Pinkie?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight! I can't believe we're partners for a game! I love games! And I'm super duper excited for ''this'' game because it'll be my first time ever playing, and I get to play with you, which makes it even funner!
:[zip!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight and Pinkie Pie forever! Ooh! We could be Team Twinkie! Or [gasps] Team Pink-Light! [gasps] Sparkle Pie! No-no-no-no! [gasps] Twi-Pie! [squee]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, I'm glad you're excited, but tonight's game is special. I could be the first pony ever to win three consecutive Trots in a row. And I'm really hoping I do.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You don't have anything to worry about. I'll do everything I can to be the bestest and most funnest teammate ever.
:[bell ringing]
:'''Spike''': So... still think you can win?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [exhales] I know I can. Pinkie might not be the partner I expected, but I can coach her along. And besides, I'm pretty good at this game. If she misses a few, I'm sure I can pick up the slack.
:[airhorn blows]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Let's get this party started!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs nervously]

:'''Granny Smith''': Now, the first order of business is we need somepony to keep score.
:'''Spike''': I'll do it!
:'''Applejack''': [laughs] I'm not sure you wanna take that job, Spike. The score-keepin' can get a mite intense.
:'''Sunburst''': Yeah. Starlight used to do it, but now... Well, I can't even say the word "trivia" around her.
:'''Granny Smith''': [scoffs] Apple mash. Don't let them scare ya. You'll be fine. Now, let the games begin!
:[crowd cheers]
{|

:'''Applejack''':
:Get ready to get squashed! Hey, don't copy me!
|
:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:Get ready to get squished! Hey, don't copy me!
|}
:'''Granny Smith''': The first category is "Literary Figures".
:[crowd groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ooh! A category about books! We're off to a great start!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles]
:'''Granny Smith''': [clears throat] Who is the pony that despises the holiday season in the old classic ''A Hearth's Warmin' Tale''?
:[bell rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The answer is nopony! Because everypony ends up loving the holiday with singing, festive cakes, and thoughtful presents!
:[beat]
:'''Granny Smith''': Well, as much as that ain't exactly wrong, it ain't exactly right neither.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs nervously]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whines]
:'''Spike''': Just doing my job, Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sorry. I didn't know we could have negative points.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's fine, Pinkie. But maybe it'll help our chances if I coach you as we go. Tip one – try sitting still.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Can do, Coach Twilight—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And don't get distracted. Or ''be'' distracting. Oh, and remember to listen carefully. Also, it's best to keep quiet between questions.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Got it.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whimpers] Sitting still, sitting still, sitting still...! [continues under]
:'''Granny Smith''': Which topographical locale used to be a cavern, but after thousands of years of erosion, is now a gorge?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?!
:[bell rings]
:'''Maud Pie''': The answer is the Ghastly Gorge.
:'''Granny Smith''': That is one hundred percent correct!
:'''Applejack''': [chomp]
:'''Granny Smith''': The next category is "Apples"!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rigged!
:'''Applejack''': I didn't hear ''you'' complain when the category was "Wonderbolt History".
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But... [stutters] that-that's totally different!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, Pinkie. Remember, the category is "Apples". Keep your mind on apples.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Apples, apples, apples, apples... Ooh, and oranges. And grapes! And strawberries. [gasps] Strawberry cupcakes! I'm hungry.
:'''Granny Smith''': Which variety of apple only blooms for five days?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [coughs] Don't choke. [whistles]
:'''Applejack''': Now, why would I choke on a question about apples? Uh... What was the question again?
:'''Granny Smith''': You kiddin' me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Come on, Pinkie, you know this one. Mysterious apples? Only around for five days?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[stomach growls]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Quiet down there. Pretty sure there's a rule against tummies ringing in.
:[bell rings]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, I'm just guessing, but is it zap apples?
:'''Granny Smith''': Finally! Yes, Fluttershy, it is. At least ''somepony'' here knows her apples.
:'''Bulk Biceps''': Yeah!
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': [weak laugh]
:[stomach growls]

:'''Spike''': One minute left in the refreshment/bathroom break—! Aah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike! I don't think I can coach Pinkie well enough for us to get my three-peat! I don't want her to feel bad! She's trying so hard, but I might have to start answering everything myself!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Look, Twilight! No more belly growl interruptions for Team Twi-Pie! [chomps, gulps]
:'''Spike''': Maybe instead of focusing on Pinkie, you should just focus on how ''you're'' playing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Or... I should look at how everypony else is playing.
:'''Granny Smith''': Hope you're all in your seats 'cause the break is over, and it is time for more questions. [muttering] Let me see, uh... How do you say "reward" in Olde Ponish?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[smack!]
:[bell rings]
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': [snoring]
:'''Sunburst''': "Reward" in Olde Ponish is "''hliet''".
:'''Granny Smith''': Correct!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Sleeping!''
:[crowd muttering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [clears throat] Sunburst's partner is sleeping. And according to rule fifty-seven point six, sleeping on the table is subject to dis-qual-i-fi-ca-tion!
:'''Granny Smith''': Oh, looky here. That's an actual rule. Cranky is disqualified. I'm sorry, Sunburst. Without your teammate, you can't play neither.
:'''Sunburst''': Aw, fine! But I'm counting that as a correct answer! [groans] Can't even stay awake for five minutes...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't worry, Pinkie. We're not out of this game yet.

:'''Angel''': [whispering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:[bell rings]
:'''Fluttershy''': Is the answer carrots?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah! Rule thirteen point two! No help from pets!

:'''Applejack''': Nyah!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nyah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rule seventy-two point eight! No sticking tongues out at opponents!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Motion to establish new rule! No expressionless contestants!
:'''Granny Smith''': Nice try.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fine.
:'''Granny Smith''': The next category is... "Cupcakes"!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Twilight! I know all about those! You have to let me help!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [exhales heavily] Suuuure! Just when we're finally back in the game! [laughs crazily] Why, that sounds perfect, Pinkie, but... Ooh! Isn't that a confetti appreciation parade I see?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Where?!
:[zip!]
:'''Granny Smith''': What flavor cupcakes did Princess Celestia order for Princess Luna's surprise birthday party last year?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait, what?!
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Double midnight chocolate fudge with chili pepper frosting!
:'''Granny Smith''': Correct!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey! I knew that! I made those cupcakes!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, Pinkie. But you were looking at the parade, and I didn't want our team to miss out on the point.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I guess that makes sense, but which way did that confetti parade go anyway?

:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': 1547 Pony B.E.!

:[smack!]
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Vanhoover!

:[splat]
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Cutie Pox!

:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Bananaaaaas!''

:'''Granny Smith''': The category is "Sticks and Stones".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [brays] I don't know anything about those! That's not any kind of category!
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, it's a kind of category where ''we'' know the answers and ''you'' don't.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't worry, fellow Twi-Pie. I grew up on a rock farm. I'm sure I know some of these.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating faster]
:'''Granny Smith''': What kind of stone can be used to start a fire?
:[bell rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': The black one!
:'''Maud Pie''': The answer is flint.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, that one! We both get points, right?
:'''Sunburst''': Sorry, Pinkie. Rule four – answers must be specific and exact. I'd help you if I could. I know this category pretty well.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Gee, Pinkie! I forgot the name of that famous rock in Griffonstone. Could you ask Maud?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You got it! Hey, Maud! What's the name of the famous rock in Griffonstone?
:'''Maud Pie''': Pinkie, you can't ask me that.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure I can. I just did.
:[crowd muttering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?
:'''Granny Smith''': You can't go and ask another player about rocks when that's the category. It's in the rulebook. Where's... Sorry, Pinkie, but you're disqualified.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?!
:[loud thud]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': I-I can't believe I'm disqualified! [whines]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs nervously] I'm sorry, Pinkie. Guess I forgot about that rule.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, no! If I'm out, you don't have a partner! You won't be able to get your third win!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, since there's another player who has also had his teammate disqualified...
:'''Sunburst''': Rule nineteen point seven B, whereby players whose teammates were disqualified may form a new team.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. Okay. Um, I'll just cheer you on from... over there.
:[balloons deflate]
:'''Granny Smith''': The next category is "Ancient Legends".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, we're gonna crush this round!
:'''Sunburst''': I don't know, Twilight. You seem out of the zone today. But don't worry. I can pick up the slack.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?! I am the reigning Trot champ! If there's any slack that needs picking, I'll be the up! I mean, wait...
:'''Sunburst''': I'm just saying you seem a little frazzled, and I do have a correct answer percentage to maintain.
:'''Granny Smith''': Who traveled to Equestria from a distant land seeking to steal the magic from its pony inhabitants?
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That would be Lord Tirek!
:[bell rings]
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, that answer is incomplete. The answer is Lord Tirek ''and'' Scorpan.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But Scorpan tried to convince Tirek ''not'' to do it, so technically he wasn't part of it, even if he started out—! [groans] Never mind.

:[montage music]
:[bell rings]

:[bell rings]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Look, Sunburst. I realize I may have been a little off earlier, but I'm really good at this game.
:'''Granny Smith''': How many holes are there in Daring Do's hat?
:[bell rings]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Twenty!
:'''Granny Smith''': Correct!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ha!
:'''Sunburst''': Twilight, I knew that one! You just cost us a point ''and'' the correct answer I needed to boost my percentage!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I knew it, too. You're not the only pony to ever read a book, you know?
:'''Sunburst''': You're right, Twilight. I'm sorry. But now that I think about it, I'm not so sure about Dash's answer. Could you do a quick fact check?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I know it's twenty. But if you want proof... Wait! According to rule eighteen point three, I can't check outside reference material.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Are you trying to get me disqualified?! What kind of pony would do that to their own teammate?!
:'''Sunburst''': You're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. I was so focused on my correct answers, I wasn't thinking straight. Can you forgive me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's okay, Sunburst. I understand. And I have a teammate of my own to apologize to. Lucky for you, Cranky's awake. And according to rule fifty-seven point six B...
:'''Sunburst''': Players previously disqualified for sleeping may rejoin the game. Provided they're well-rested.
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': [mutters] Where am I? What time is it? Where are my morning haycakes?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, you were the best teammate I could ask for, but I let wanting to win keep me from seeing that.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [scoffs] I knew you wanted to win, but I probably could have helped a little. And even if I couldn't...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...we still could've had fun. I'm so sorry for not realizing it. I got so obsessed with one thing, I forgot what really mattered.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sarcastically] No! That doesn't sound like you at all!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, win or lose, nothing is more important than my friend. Or my team. Twi-Pie forever?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I-I don't know.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I understand. I guess even the Princess of Friendship can mess things up with her friends.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, it's not that. It's  just that I already changed it to Team Twi-Burst, and now I guess I should change it to Sun-Doodle? [chomps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, I have a better idea.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': According to rule thirteen point two, players can join the game at any time, provided they start from zero.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wow. These rules are really convoluted. But doesn't starting from zero mean we'll lose?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, our chances aren't good, but the odds of having fun on Team Twi-Pie are one hundred percent!
:'''Granny Smith''': What is the name of the Ponyville Day Spa's most popular candle?
:[bell rings]
{|
|
:'''Pinkie Pie''':
:Candlelicious Melty Wax!
|
:'''Twilight Sparkle''':
:Competitive Library Musk!

:'''Granny Smith''': Uh... no.

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:'''Cozy Glow''': [clears throat] Where are ya goin'?
:'''Grogar''': Since you three were unable to retrieve my Bewitching Bell, we need another source of great magical power to defeat Twilight and her friends.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [singsongy] He's gone!
:'''Lord Tirek''': I don't trust him.
:'''Cozy Glow''': None of us do.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Which is why double-crossing him with his own bell will be so satisfying.
:'''Lord Tirek''': ''If'' we can figure out how to use it.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Hmmm...
:[rattling]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Twilight Sparkle may be the worst, but she does know stuff. She once said the Archives in Canterlot has a restricted area.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Celestia and Luna love to hoard information for themselves. If there's an answer, it's there.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': My triumphant return to Canterlot? I like the sound of that.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, my gosh! Road trip!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[door opens]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Sorry to interrupt. We know you're busy planning the Summer Sun Celebration as we requested. But...
:'''Princess Luna''': Oh! Things seem, uh, calmer than we would've expected.
:'''Spike''': No complaints here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': With the exception of the odd trivia night, I've made a lot of progress since the Royal Swanifying Ceremony. You may not know this about me, but I occasionally freak out.
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That was a joke. I wanted to show you with the Summer Sun Celebration how much I've improved. So I focused on delegating and trusting others. It's been great!
:'''Princess Luna''': That's... actually what we came to talk to you about. This may be the last Summer Sun Celebration you'll need to plan.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Did I do something wrong?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Of course not. It's just that the Celebration has always been about us. My defeat of Luna...
:'''Princess Luna''': ...and, thanks to you and your friends, my reunion with my sister.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Now that we're leaving, we don't see a need for the holiday any longer.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now that you're...
:'''Princess Celestia''': My sister and I have decided. The time for us to retire is upon us. You and your friends have proven you are ready to lead Equestria. So let this be the last Summer Sun Celebration as Equestria leaves behind the old to embrace the new!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gulps]

:'''Rarity''': My goodness! How are ''you'' feeling about all this?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Something like this could definitely send you into full freaky-outy mode!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm actually fine. But if this is gonna be the last Summer Sun Celebration, I want to make sure it's the best Celebration ever!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whispering] Please-don't-give-us-more-work... Please-don't-give-us-more-work... Please-don't-give-us-more-work...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, even though everything was done, I thought of a few last-minute changes I could use your help with.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] I knew it!
:'''Discord''': [echoing] Oh, the end of a beloved holiday? Last-minute changes to a celebration?
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': That sounds positively chaotic!
:'''Applejack''': What are ''you'' doin' here?
:'''Discord''': I've known Celestia and Luna longer than any of you. I terrorized them, they turned me into stone...
:[crack]
:[crumble]
:'''Discord''': If this is the last Summer Sun Situation, I simply can't miss it. Well, I see I've arrived just in time for the "Twilight gives her friends an impossibly long and overly detailed list" predicament.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I guess some draconequus isn't the know-it-all he thinks he is.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This is it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We were kinda with Discord on this one.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No more crazy lists. No more freaking out. With your help, I know we've got this.
:'''Discord''': [groans] Character growth is so boring. Do I at least get my own note card?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There. Now, I need to go rewrite my speech. But if you all look at your cards, you'll see—
:'''Discord''': Can't talk now. Have so much to get done before sunrise. [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]
:[clatter]

:'''Lord Tirek''': Why are so many ponies up in the middle of the night?
:'''Cozy Glow''': It's that silly sun holiday.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': How many holidays do you ponies have? No matter. Getting into the castle won't be a problem.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Are you sure about that?
:[fans whirring]
:[bird chirping]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Oh. Those are new. But even so...
:[transformation noise]

:[wood creaking]
:'''{{H:title|as royal guard|Queen Chrysalis}}''': [affected voice] Transfer. Have to head inside. Open up.
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''{{H:title|as royal guard|Queen Chrysalis}}''': Right. Of course. [laughs nervously]
:[thuds]
:'''{{H:title|as royal guard|Queen Chrysalis}}''': Uh, do yours get glitchy too? More medallions, more problems, am I right?

:'''{{H:title|as royal guard|Queen Chrysalis}}''': [normal voice] They've increased security into the castle. This is going to be more challenging than I thought.
:[transformation noise]
:[poof!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Could you not go popping us all over the place, please?!
:'''Discord''': Time is of the essence. Let's go, team!
:'''Fluttershy''': We need to know what we're doing before we go and do it.
:'''Applejack''': Pinkie, you and I are givin' Braeburn and the Appleloosan ponies some adjustments to the menu.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fluttershy and I are meeting the Pegasi from Cloudsdale to give them changes to the weather.
:'''Rarity''': Spike, we're going to update the Flaming Sky Firework Unicorn Troupe with Twilight's new vision.
:'''Discord''': And I'm supposed to... [reading] "make sure Discord doesn't do anything 'Discord-y'"? Well, that's annoyingly specific!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Increased security on a crowded holiday with Twilight and her friends bumbling around? This is impossible.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Oh, no. This is perfect. We need a distraction, and those ridiculous ponies just gave it to us. Now, do exactly as I tell you.

:[ponies gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Step away from the wagons! Official food-tasters here on official food-tasting business! [eating noisily]
:'''Braeburn''': [sighs] Well, it ain't gonna be easy. But I think we can whip up these new cookies Twilight wants before sunrise.
:'''Applejack''': If anypony can handle some last-minute bakin', Braeburn, it's y'all.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [chomps, gulps]
:'''Braeburn''': We brought plenty for the Celebration. But if she keeps testin', we might be in trouble.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [chomps, gulps] But I see a suspicious-looking cookie!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Braeburn''': You okay?
:[bushes rustle]
:'''Apple Honey''': I feel weak all of a sudden...
:[magic sounds]
:'''Braeburn''': Is somepony back there?
:[magic sounds]
:'''Apple Cobbler''': What is it?
:'''Braeburn''': Everypony... get away from the food... 'til we figure out what's goin' on...!
:[ponies screaming]
:[bushes rustle]
:'''Lord Tirek''': [laughing]

:'''Feather Flatterfly''': The princess wants ''what?!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Just what's on that little card. No big deal.
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': No big d-d—?! I-I-It's a m-much more aggressive weather pattern than what was originally ordered! This... This is... very irregular! We'll need to... No, first we must... Wait! We ca— [wails]
:'''Fluttershy''': Take a breath.
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': [inhales]
:'''Fluttershy''': Let it out slowly.
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': [exhales] Tell the princess we will do our best.
:'''Fluttershy''': We're sure you're doing an excellent job.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, yeah, totally. You're not gonna panic and screw it up at all!
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': I... I... I'm not built for high-pressure situations!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Golly. Sounds like you need some help.
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': Who are you?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Somepony who's organized enough to handle the small stuff so you can focus on the big picture!
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': The big... Yes! That sounds right!
:'''Cozy Glow''': [chuckles] This kind of weather has to be handled delicately. Good thing I'm here. I'll take care of everything.

:[fireworks explode]
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Rarity''': The Flaming Sky Firework Troupe is a marvel.
:'''Fire Flare''': We take pride in what we do.
:'''Spike''': These last-minute changes aren't too challenging, are they?
:'''Fire Flare''': Ha! The more challenging, the better! We aim to astound! Now, if you don't mind, we do have a new routine to prepare. Horns at the ready!
:[transformation noise]
:'''{{H:title|as Crackle Cosette|Queen Chrysalis}}''': Very impressive.
:'''Fire Flare''': Thank you. Unfortunately, we have no room for anypony else at this time... [clears throat] I'm sorry?
:'''{{H:title|as Crackle Cosette|Queen Chrysalis}}''': Crackle Cosette. And I don't want to join your silly little troupe.
:'''Fire Flare''': Pardon me?
:'''{{H:title|as Crackle Cosette|Queen Chrysalis}}''': Oh, I meant no offense. It just seems a pity for unicorns to waste their talents on something so... inconsequential.
:[unicorns muttering]
:'''{{H:title|as Crackle Cosette|Queen Chrysalis}}''': Unicorns wield magic. We are the most powerful ponies in the land. Don't you ever feel you're destined for more than... performances?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's all coming together. I really think this is gonna be the best Summer Sun Celebration ever!
:'''Rarity''': You've done an outstanding job.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We've all done an outstanding job!
:[screech]
:'''Discord''': And what about me? You'll be happy to know that I have been watching myself all night, and I have yet to do one "Discord-y" thing.
:'''Princess Luna''': Now, that truly is amazing.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight, we know you had, uh, [laughs] difficulties using the amulet to raise the sun and moon. We thought perhaps a practice session before the festivities might be in order.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's... a good idea. Thank you all so much.
:[doors close]
:'''Applejack''': I sure am proud o' her.
:'''Spike''': Yeah! She finally realizes things will turn out fine, even when she isn't micromanaging every little detail.
:[thud]
:'''Applejack''': Braeburn? W-What's wrong?
:'''Braeburn''': Earth ponies sick... Food missin'... Can't... bake... anythin'...
:'''Royal Guard''': Something is wrong with the weather! Storms, hurricanes, fog – you name it! It's a disaster out there!
:'''Fire Flare''': Rarity! Please inform her highness that we will not be performing! A simple fireworks show is beneath us! We're better than that!
:'''Applejack''': What the...? Everything was fine a minute ago!
:'''Fluttershy''': Apparently, a lot can change in a minute.
:[ponies moaning]
:[thunder]
:[ponies panicking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's total chaos out there!
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Don't look at me.
:'''Fluttershy''': What are we gonna do?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do about what?
:'''Spike''': [laughs nervously] What are you doing here?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I forgot these. You guys okay?
:'''Applejack''': Twilight, w-we're sorry, but—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But, uh, we don't know what to do now that everything's all ready! [forced laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I guess I was too organized. I'll try to come up with a few last-minute errands for you before sunrise.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [stilted] Well, that's a relief!
:'''Applejack''': Explain to me why we didn't tell her the truth.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, Twilight is finally learning not to let her stress get the better of her. If she finds out everything went wrong, it could be devastating!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, she would be so upset.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': She'll totally freak out!
:'''Applejack''': Well, what do y'all suggest?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh, ooh, ooh! Let's just fix it all before she notices. No lying necessary.
:'''Applejack''': I guess.
:'''Spike''': We'd need a miracle.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We ''have'' a miracle! Don't we?
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': I suppose I ''could'' fix everything. But isn't the real miracle here the miracle of teamwork and character growth?
:[poof!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''OH, COME ON!''
:'''Fluttershy''': Discord is right. Twilight needs ''us''. Whatever happened, we can fix this.
:[thunder and lightning]
:'''Spike''': What ''did'' happen?
:[ponies screaming]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Best... road trip... ever!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Even if I was an actual doctor, I would have no idea what's wrong.
:'''Applejack''': There's gotta be a reason. Something got 'em all sick. Maybe the food?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I ate the food, too! Does that mean ''I'm'' sick?! Oh, nooo! [coughs]
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nope! I feel fine. [chomps]

:[magic sounds]
:[thud]
:[unlatching sounds]
:[doors open]

:[thunder and lightning]
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': I don't know how this happened! I'm gonna be fired for... for sure!
:'''Fluttershy''': Rainbow Dash and the Wonderbolts will have all the weather rounded up any minute.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [yelling]
:[crash!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Or not!

:[door opens]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Not here. The Archives are in a different part of the castle.
:[goose honks]

:'''Rarity''': What about "aiming for perfection"?
:'''Fire Flare''': We've set our sights higher.
:'''Spike''': Higher than perfection?
:'''Fire Flare''': Higher than putting on a silly little show for the other ponies.
:'''Rarity''': But you were so excited before. What changed?

:[goose honks]
:'''{{H:title|as a goose|Queen Chrysalis}}''': [honks]
:[transformation noise]
:[clanking]
:[creak]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You two just enjoy the festivities. I have a few surprises in store for— Yes, Discord?
:'''Discord''': Oh, well, don't mind me. I'm just here for the chaos.
:[thunder and lightning]
:'''Discord''': [laughs] And here we go!
:[whoosh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What is Rainbow Dash doing?
:[sloshing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, is this soup?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yes! I... was really hungry?
:[unicorns grumbling]
:'''Rarity''': Nopony understands wanting to take pride in your work more than I do!
:'''Unicorn 1''': You could do more with your magic than make frilly dresses!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, pffft. Nopony makes frills anymore. This season's actually all about simplicity—
:'''Spike''': Not the point, Rarity!
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': Princess! I beg your forgiveness! It's entirely my fault!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What is?
:[thunder and lightning]
:'''Feather Flatterfly''': ''That!''
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, um, just a slight hiccup in the weather. [laughs nervously]
:[whoosh]
:'''Applejack''': [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Applejack, what is going on?
:'''Applejack''': I told y'all this was a bad idea! But nopony ever listens to me!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's it!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [yelp, groan]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I thought everything was fine! What is going on?!
:'''Applejack''': Everythin' ''was'' goin' fine.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Until it totally wasn't.
:'''Fluttershy''': We tried to fix it ourselves.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Why didn't you tell me?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We didn't want you to freak out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And you thought ''not'' telling me everything was a total disaster would ''avoid'' a freak-out?!
:'''Spike''': When you say it like that, it sounds like a really bad plan.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [inhales]
:'''Discord''': Here it comes!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know how I used to react, but I really have changed. Panicking won't solve anything. But we can handle whatever problems come our way as long as we handle them together!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Spoken like a true leader. How can we help?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I love a good to-do list. So tell me exactly what happened so we can figure out exactly what "to do" to fix it.

:[montage music]
:[whooshing]
:[muffled boom]
:[poof!]
:[poof!]
:[creaking]

:[chains rattling]
:[clang!]

:[whooshing]
:[thunder]
:[fireworks]
:'''Fire Flare''': [whistles]
:[fireworks]
:[trumpet fanfare]
:[cranking]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [amplified] This Celebration has always been a reminder not to fear the night, for there is always a new day to look forward to. But as we look towards Equestria's future, I am sad to say today will be the last Summer Sun Celebration.
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Because there is something even more important to celebrate. There are two ponies who have watched over us night and day for as long as we can remember. We will no longer commemorate their battle or their reunion. Instead, we will take this day to celebrate how much they mean to all of us. From this day forward, today will be known as the Festival of the Two Sisters!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Princess Celestia''': We don't know what to say.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [giggles] A brand new holiday? You're my kind of princess!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm just glad we pulled it off.
:'''Applejack''': About that... We just wanted to say we're real sorry.
:'''Rarity''': You did tell us you'd changed.
:'''Fluttershy''': As your friends, we should've trusted you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Next time you say you're not gonna freak out, we'll believe you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Good. Because I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of things I'll need my best friends' help with.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whee-hee!
:'''Mane Six except Pinkie Pie''': Aah!
:[thud]
:'''Mane Six''': [laughing]
:'''Discord''': You know, it really does seem like you just might be ready for whatever comes next, your Majesty. [chewing]

:'''Cozy Glow''': Sooooo did you find what you're looking for?
:'''Grogar''': Once again, I've found success where you all find failure. I have located what I sought, and tomorrow I will set out to retrieve it. When I return, Equestria will finally be ours for the taking.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Hmph!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Oh, stop pouting.
:'''Cozy Glow''': You knew you couldn't stay that buff. You had to return all the life force to those Earth ponies so Grogar doesn't suspect anything.
:'''Lord Tirek''': I don't have to like it.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Well, I don't like that we worked so hard to destroy their party and they still pulled it off. But you don't see me complaining!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Our goal wasn't to destroy. It was to distract. And now we have exactly what we need.
:'''Lord Tirek''': And no time to waste. We have to master the Bell before Grogar returns.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': We've managed to stay one step ahead of everypony so far.
:'''Cozy Glow''': You know, it really was super easy to get all those Earth ponies and Pegasi and unicorns to turn on each other.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': It was, wasn't it? Now that is something to think about...

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:'''Antoine''': [hissing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh. Antoine believes what he eats is his business. Do other predators feel that way, too?
:[animals chattering]
:'''Fluttershy''': Would anyprey like to respond? Muriel, does it bother you when Antoine tries to eat you? Just because you're on opposite ends of the food chain doesn't mean you can't work—
:'''Muriel''': [trumpets]
:'''Fluttershy''': Huh? It doesn't mean you can't...
:'''Harry''': [roars]
:'''Fluttershy''': [clears throat, strained] It doesn't mean you can't work togeth—
:'''Sandra''': [growls, chomps]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! [sighs] I'm sorry, but the more you distract everyone, the longer this will take.
:'''Angel''': [angry chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': I ''am'' listening to you. But if you really want to be heard, you should join our predator/prey support group. Then you can talk to everyone here. You could teach all these hungry predators the delights of a carrot-based cuisine. Sorry, everyone. I think somebunny just wants a little attention. Now, since we all need to get along, what if all predators promise to only eat vegetables while staying at the sanctuary?
:'''Harry''': [low growl]
:[animals chattering]
:'''Sandra''': [whines]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, Sandra, you can do it.
:[stomach growls]
:'''Sandra''': [whines, growls]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Angel, Sandra, wait!
:'''Sandra''': [barking]
:[rumbling]
:'''Harry''': [roars]
:[crash!]
:[animal sounds]
:[fighting sounds]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': It might look like chaos, but Fluttershy makes it work, even with Angel running around.
:'''Zecora''': Ohhhh. Perhaps I can help those two get along before something here can go terribly wrong.

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[birds chirping]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Zecora found this little guy and brought him to my office. But I thought he might do better at the sanctuary.
:[poof]
:'''Angel''': [coughing]
:'''Zecora''': Bringing him here seemed the right thing to do. I've never seen geckos breathe smoke though. Have you?
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh. I certainly haven't.
:'''Dr. Fauna''': I thought we could take a look at his diet. Plus, it's about time for me to give all the animals here a checkup.
:'''Fluttershy''': That's a wonderful idea.
:[lizard chirping]
:'''Fluttershy''': If we really want to know what's going on, we need to make sure the problem isn't your food.
:[stomach growls]
:'''Fluttershy''': I wouldn't worry too much. It's probably just something he's been eating. Oh. [grunts] Um, is there anything else we can do for you?
:'''Zecora''': Ahhh. Seeing what you two do, the real question is – can ''I'' help ''you''?
:'''Angel''': [blows raspberry]
:'''Fluttershy''': You mean me and Angel?
:'''Zecora''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, he's fine! We're fine! I... I just don't always have time to indulge him. But we're best friends!
:'''Zecora''': Even the best of friends need help from time to time. Come visit me in my hut, should you change your mind.
:'''Fluttershy''': Okay, thanks! But Angel and I are great!
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Oh, goodness, Fluttershy. Is this the list of what you do every day? [chuckles] How do you find time for anything else?
:'''Fluttershy''': Between here and teaching at the school, I'm not sure I do. You're gonna love it here, little gecko.
:[lizard chirps]
:'''Fluttershy''': What is it? Not fluffy enough?
:[lizard chirps]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, sorry. We need to see if your food is causing your issue.
:[lizard purring]
:'''Fluttershy''': Huh? Hmm. Not now, Angel.

:'''Antoine''': [hisses]
:'''Fluttershy''': There's snake treats made to look like chocolate chip cookies.
:'''Antoine''': [chews, gulps]
:'''Fluttershy''': They're vegan. Pinkie Pie made a whole jar of them. They're all yours if you promise. No more trying to eat Muriel the baby elephant. [gasps] No, Angel. I have too much to do.

:'''Clementine''': [coughing]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Oh, careful, girl. That neck is still pretty sore.
:'''Fluttershy''': Don't forget to shift your weight, Scout!
:'''Scout''': [snoring]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': [sighs] What does she want?
:'''Fluttershy''': Her neck is feeling better, but a massage every day for the next week wouldn't hurt. I'll add it to my list.
:'''Dr. Fauna''': [laughs] Fluttershy, I've said it before, but I'll say it again. This place would be a... ''zoo'' without you! [laughs, snorts]
:[thunk!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Angel!
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': Listen to you for once? Just what exactly is that supposed to mean?!
:'''Angel''': [chitters]
:'''Fluttershy''': Come back! I-I meant tell me, not—! [groans]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Well, whatever it is, you're the only one he can tell about it. Little fella just wants you all to himself.
:'''Fluttershy''': Unfortunately, that's not an option.
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Aw, he's not causing any real trouble.
:[crash!]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Aah!
:[birds chirping]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Other than that, possibly.
:[crash!]
:'''Muriel''': [trumpets]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Or that. I'll just stop talking.
:[zip!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [groans] I'll take care of it. I hope this is important, Angel. I barely made a dent in my to-do list for today.
:[door opens]
:'''Fluttershy''': Concentrated carrot extract? That's for reviving energy-sapped herbivores. Are you feeling rundown?
:'''Angel''': [chitters]
:'''Fluttershy''': You just like the taste?! Ugh! Angel, that extract is in short supply! What's gotten into you? Every day this week, you've been causing trouble when I have work to do!
:'''Angel''': [chitters]
:'''Fluttershy''': Of course I know you can't talk to anypony else. But that's not ''my'' fault. I have responsibilities!
:'''Angel''': [growls]
:'''Fluttershy''': You're right. We can't go on like this. I guess we do need to see Zecora for help.

:'''Zecora''': No need to sit and silently stew. Tell each other what's bothering you.
:'''Fluttershy''': He's so impatient, even when he knows I have work to do.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, that's not true. We talk all the time.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': Of course talking at the sanctuary counts. That's where I am when I don't have a class to teach.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': What do you mean that's the problem?
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': You feel like I'm the only pony you can talk to, and all I do is ignore you? Well, ''I'' feel like you don't care about my responsibilities.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': [laughs nervously] Um, as you can see, we're kind of at an impasse.
:'''Zecora''': Ahhh, such luck, your coming here indeed. Behold, the antidote you need.
:'''Fluttershy''': Is this what you meant by "help us"?
:'''Zecora''': When trouble brews between you two, turning sister against brother, true understanding is what's due. Each must come to know the other. There's no time to waste. Go directly home. But you both must taste when you're finally alone.

:'''Fluttershy''': Not yet, Angel. Zecora told us to take it together when we got home.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmm. I suppose we could dust off the old picnic blanket. It'll be just like old times. We'll drink the potion and settle in for a nice tea party. I can barely remember the last time we did that. I've been so busy at the sanctuary. Though I really need to keep an eye on Zecora's gecko, and I haven't finished any of today's chores. If I don't, the animals won't get the care they need. Ohh. Maybe we should just save the potion until af— Angel! Zecora said to go home first!
:[pop!]
:[splash]
:'''Angel''': [gulps, burps]
:'''Fluttershy''': I know she said we have to take it together, so... I guess I have to.
:[pop!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gulping, belches] I wonder what it's gonna doooo—
:[magic sounds]
:{{portray|Angel}}: —whooooaaaa!
:[thud]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hang on, hold up! Am I a pony? Why am I a pony?!
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: [high-pitched scream]

:{{portray|Angel}}: Question. Did we switch bodies?
:[thud]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Whoa! Gah! Guh! Whoooaaa-whoa-whoa! Seriously? I'm a pony? La-la-la-la! Talking is so cool. Do you think this is what Zecora meant to happen?
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: How are you gonna do your chores?! Really? ''That's'' what you're worried about?
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: [scoffs] Well, maybe I don't want to switch back. I've only been able to talk to ''you'' since we met. And now I can talk to anypony I want! [to Rose] Roses are red, violets are blue! You sell flowers... [to Daisy] ...and so do you!
:[zip!]
:{{portray|Angel}}: [to "Cultivar"] Rubber baby buggy bumpers! [to Cream Puff] Rubber baby buggy bumpers!
:'''Cream Puff''': [crying]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Toy boat, toy boat, toy bo— Aah! Aw, come on!
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: I am so too listening! Quit being so bossy because—! [gasps, sniffs] Are there carrots around here?
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: You think Zecora gave us the wrong potion, so you're gonna go to her hut in the forest and get something to switch us back?
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: All by yourself? You really don't know what it's like being a bunny.
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Good luck with that! I'm gonna go find those carrots!
:[thudding]
:{{portray|Angel}}: I need to finish your chores? [laughs] I don't work for you. And caring about other animals is a "you" thing.
:[warbling]
:{{portray|Angel}}: [gasps] The Stare?! You can still do that? Ugh! No fair making me do your bidding against my will!
:[warbling]
:{{portray|Angel}}: All right! I'll go do your lame chores while you go see Zecora.

:[splash]
:'''Clementine''': [slurping]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Anypony know where that useless list of Fluttershy's chores is?
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Hey, Fluttershy! I was starting to wonder if you'd make it back.
:{{portray|Angel}}: Fluttershy! Oh! Yeah! Uh, that's me! Definitely Fluttershy! A hundred percent!
:[beat]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Uh, okay.
:{{portray|Angel}}: See how ''shy'' I am? Hmm? I talk to animals, I want to marry Discord—
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Your list is over there.
:{{portray|Angel}}: [sarcastically] Oh, yeah. There's my good old list of chores that I will absolutely ''not'' rush through because I definitely do not have better things to do. Well, well, well. Remember me?

:'''Spike''': [shudders] I hope the gem tart stall is still there again. I could use a snack!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You nearly bought every tart they had last time, Spike. I can't imagine they wouldn't show up when there's a great customer like you. Oh, hi, Angel. What's going on?
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do you know what he's trying to say?
:'''Spike''': Nope.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, Angel. You should probably find Fluttershy. If I see her, I'll let her know you're looking for her.
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: [panting]
:[tense music]

:'''Sandra''': [stressed barking, whines]
:{{portray|Angel}}: And we're gonna keep at it until you start to develop a taste for it!
:'''Sandra''': [whines]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Uh... [reading] "Check Muriel's trunk."
:'''Muriel''': [exhales, deep inhale]
:[keys jingling]
:[thunk]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Eh, seems fine to me. As long as we don't need those keys.
:'''Muriel''': [whines]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Anyway, let's see. [reading] "Massage Clementine's neck."
:'''Clementine''': [coughing]
:[hard thuds]
:'''Clementine''': [coughing]
:{{portray|Angel}}: [reading] "Get Scout to switch legs"?
:'''Scout''': [snoring]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Eh, probably best not to wake him. Did the thing with the thing, yadda-yadda-yadda, animals, animals, animals... All that's left is... "Monitor Zecora's gecko until bedtime"?
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: All right, dude. How about we do bedtime now?
:[lizard chirps]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Yeah, eating makes me tired, too. Which reminds me. There's some carrot extract with my name on it. Okay! Let's get you fed and off to dreamland! What do you eat anyway?
:[lizard chirps]
:{{portray|Angel}}: [to Antoine] What do you say, snake? Can you find something else to eat if I borrow those cookies for my friend here?
:[jar clinks]
:[lizard gulping, burps]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Eh, I'm sure that's normal. There you go. Problem solved. I don't see what's so hard about this job. Fluttershy is such a whiner.
:'''Antoine''': [hissing]

:[thud]
:[bushes rustling]
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: [panting, squeals]
:[eagle squawking]

:[thud]
:{{portray|Fluttershy}}: [panting]
:'''Zecora''': Quite a day, my fuzzy friend. Did things work out for you in the end?
:[beat]
:'''Zecora''': I'm... sorry, dear bunny, that things seem so grave. But I don't understand when you sign and wave. A single link to all the world. Only one in all the land. How special she must be to you, the one who understands. Perhaps if you explain what you wanted to some pony who understood. If you truly felt heard and valued, all would return to good. ''And'' if you were to both apologize, having learned this little lesson, I imagine that might bring an end to the friendship therapy session.

:[door creaking]
:{{portray|Angel}}: [grunting]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Fluttershy? Do you mind helping me look for Muriel the baby elephant?
:{{portray|Angel}}: Oh, she's having dinner with Antoine.
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Antoine the python?!
:{{portray|Angel}}: It was on the list. "Remember – Antoine wants to have Muriel over for dinner."
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Not OVER for dinner! He wants to have her FOR dinner!
:{{portray|Angel}}: Wait. What?!

:'''Muriel''': [muffled trumpeting]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Bad snake! Open your mouth this instant, mister!
:[mice squeaking]
:'''Sandra''': [growls, barks, whines, barks]
:'''Harry''': [growls]
:[crack!]
:'''Scout''': [crying]
:'''Clementine''': [coughs]
:[fire whooshes]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Aah! What is going on?! You did all the chores on your list! Huh?! Didn't you?!
:{{portray|Angel}}: Well, technically I did 'em, kind of. But more technically, it's not ''my'' list.
:'''Dr. Fauna''': You wrote it!
:{{portray|Angel}}: Did I though?
:'''Dr. Fauna''': What's gotten into you?!
:{{portray|Angel}}: You do ''not'' want to know.
:[thud]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Huh? Angel?
:{{portray|Angel}}: What's wrong with her— h-him?! What happened?
:'''Dr. Fauna''': He's exhausted!
:{{portray|Angel}}: [whimpers]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Fluttershy! I need a jar of concentrated carrot extract! Stat!
:{{portray|Angel}}: Ah! It's locked in the supply room!
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Where are your keys?!
:{{portray|Angel}}: Uhhh...

:'''Muriel''': [muffled trumpeting]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Any ideas how to get the keys out of the elephant that's inside the snake?
:[animals grunt]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Okay, point taken. And I totally deserve it. I did not provide you with the care that Fluttershy would. But now you know what it's like not to get the level of attention to which you've become accustomed!
:'''Sandra''': [grunts]
:{{portray|Angel}}: The point is... Fluttershy is trapped in my bunny body. If we don't help her, maybe none of us will get her attention! I get that you don't want to help ''me''. But don't you want to help ''her''?
:[animals chattering]
:'''Sandra''': [grunts]

:{{portray|Angel}}: Here goes nothin'.
:[creaking]
:'''Antoine''': [hissing]
:[squirrels chittering]
:[pop!]
:'''Muriel''': [trumpets]
:[thud]
:{{portray|Angel}}: [gasps] Now we just need to get those keys out of there.
:'''Antoine''': [hisses loudly]
:'''Muriel''': [trumpets]
:[keys jingling]
:{{portray|Angel}}: [laughs] Nice one, snake. I guess Fluttershy was right. Predators and prey ''can'' work together.

:{{portray|Angel}}: [grunting, panting] This place is so... much... work!
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Oh, I know. I have no clue how you do it all. But we are so grateful.
:{{portray|Angel}}: I can't believe she does this every day! I just wish I could tell her myself.
:'''Dr. Fauna''': What?
:{{portray|Angel}}: [whimpers] You're awake!
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: It was so hard getting to Zecora's hut? And impossible getting back? You can't believe I survive like this?
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: Well, I can't believe you work here every day! These animals are crazy! No wonder you don't have time for me.
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: My life is hard? No, ''your'' life is hard!
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: You never appreciated ''me''? No! ''I'' never appreciated ''you''!
:[beat]
:{{portray|Angel}}: You're sorry? I'm sorry, too! Come here, you little bunny who's a pony who's a bunny! Ooh!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my goodness! I'm back! I'm a pony again!
:[smack!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, Angel. I promise to always make time for you from now on.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': What do you mean maybe I won't have to?
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': You want to do what?!

:'''Fluttershy''': "And that's when I realized Fluttershy doesn't have to be the only one I talk to. I can come here and talk to all of you. And now that I know how much work goes into this place, I suppose I can kinda sorta help out every now and then."
:[squirrels chitter]
:'''Sandra''': [grunts]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, Angel. That is so sweet. But now that I know what ''you'' go through every day, I understand why your time with me is so important. I promise to always make time for you.
:[animals grunt, applaud]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Turns out your friend here doesn't have a problem at all. He isn't a gecko. He's a fire lizard.
:[fire whooshes]
:'''Dr. Fauna''': I forgot that before they get their flame, it's hard to tell them apart. [laughs]
:'''Zecora''': I'm glad to discover where the source of it lies, or the fire that he breathes would be quite the surprise.
:'''Dr. Fauna''': Speaking of surprises, can you please ''never'' do that again?!

:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [singsong] Oh, Spiiiike? Are you in here? Hellooooo?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Spike?
:'''Spike''': Mm-hmm...
:'''Rarity''': Oh, there you are! I was starting to think you weren't here. I realize this is last-minute, but I've decided on a quick trip to the gem cave! I am on an urgent mission to find some faceted iridescence for my new design, and I can't think of anypony I'd rather have along than my favorite basket holder/bodyguard Spike.
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Spike?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Spiiiike?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': [echoing] ''SPIKE!''
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': What? Oh. Hey, Rarity.
:'''Rarity''': Honestly, Spike. It's almost as if you haven't been listening.
:'''Spike''': [blows fire] Oh, uh... of course I was. But just to be sure, could you say it all again?
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] I was saying that I had planned on visiting the gem cave—
:'''Spike''': Oh, no! Is that the time?!
:'''Rarity''': Aah!
:'''Spike''': [panting]
:'''Rarity''': Of course, you're right. This is a bit of a late start, and those gems won't pick themselves.
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh.
:[doors open]
:'''Rarity''': But the real question is which basket do you want to hold? The smaller one, right? [laughs]
:'''Spike''': Oh, right. Sorry, Rarity. Can I take a rain check on... What was that again?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': The... gem cave?
:'''Spike''': Right. Sounds great. But I need to get to the post office before noon.
:'''Rarity''': [laughs] All right, very funny. Obviously, you'll get the bigger basket, and I shall—
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Spike? Hello?

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[gem clinking]
:'''Rarity''': I don't understand. For as long as we've known each other, Spike has never turned down an opportunity to join me here. It's his favorite place.
:[gem clinking]
:'''Rarity''': Ideally you catch the gems, dear. And for a trip to the post office of all places?
:[gem clinking]
:'''Rarity''': Maybe you should move closer? And why would Spike need to go to the post office at all? He sends mail by breathing! Breathing, darling! Breath mail!
:[gems clinking]
:'''Rarity''': Honestly, Applejack, if you're going to fill in, you could make an attempt to hold the basket the way Spike would.
:'''Applejack''': [spits] And how's ''that''?
:'''Rarity''': Well, for one thing, Spike knows how to keep things quiet so as not to waken the bats.
:[bats squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': ''And'' he usually pulls me closely so no gem ever touches the ground!
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] Rarity, Spike's been followin' you closely since he got to Ponyville. And in case you hadn't noticed... [echoing] ''I AIN'T SPIKE!''
:[bats squeaking]
:'''Rarity''' and '''Applejack''': [yelping]
:'''Rarity''': Actually, Applejack, I ''had'' noticed!

:[doors open]
:[books thudding]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um, hi, Rarity. What's up?
:'''Rarity''': Ugh! Besides my mane? Well, that is a question for Spike.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. Well, Spike isn't here. I think he's at the post office.
:[scraping sounds]
:'''Rarity''': Again?! What is it with Spike and the post office?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rarity, what's going on?
:'''Rarity''': Spike declined my invitation to the gem cave, and I intend to find out why.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm. That doesn't sound like Spike. Did you two have some sort of fight?
:'''Rarity''': A fight? Goodness, Twilight. What in Equestria would we fight about?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've had arguments with friends before, and they can put a real strain on friendships.
:'''Rarity''': Well, certainly. But I think I'd remember if we had an argument.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe you didn't realize it? Do you think you could've done something that unintentionally hurt his feelings?
:'''Rarity''': Well, if I didn't realize what I did, how would I know what I have done when I did it? [brays] I wonder if that's it. It certainly would explain his behavior. I must apologize!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': For what?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, pfft. That's hardly the point. Poor Spikey-Wikey! This calls for a grand gesture!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. Good talk. [groans]

:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [grunting]
:[scraping]
:[clang!]
:'''Gabby''': Wow! That's a big crate of stuff you're mailing.
:'''Rarity''': I'm not mailing it.
:'''Gabby''': Then why are you pushing it into the post office?
:'''Rarity''': Oh. I didn't realize griffons worked at the Ponyville Post Office.
:'''Gabby''': Oh! [giggles] No, I don't work here exactly. I'm the official mail carrier of Griffonstone. Gabby Griffon. Nice to meet ya!
:[rattling]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Yes, well, uh, these things aren't for sending. They're for apologizing to Spike.
:'''Gabby''': Oh! Spike was just here. He went to go make us a—
:'''Rarity''': That's perfect! It'll give me a chance to practice. Uh, you stand there and tell me if I hit the right apologetic notes.
:'''Gabby''': What are you apologizing for?
:'''Rarity''': Darling, I don't see why that matters.
:[clattering]
:[gems clinking]
:[thud]
:[ka-chunk!]
:[deep boom]
:[music playing]
:'''Rarity''': [overdramatically] And that is why I simply cannot bear the thought of having hurt you! And even though I don't know what it is that I did, I want you to know that it doesn't matter! Because I am prepared to do anything to make it right! [sobs] And scene.
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Gabby''': [muffled speech]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, sorry, dear. Here.
:'''Gabby''': I said, that sure sounds genuine.
:'''Rarity''': Well, of course it sounds genuine! It ''is'' genuine!
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': Rarity? What are you doing?
:'''Rarity''': Obviously, I'm working on my apology to you, Spike. I don't know how I could be more genuine. I mean— [gasps] Spike!
:[zip!]
:[ka-chunk!]
:[deep boom]
:[music playing]
:'''Rarity''': [overdramatically] Oh, Spike! I am so sorry! Please forgive me!
:[crash!]
:[cat yowls]
:'''Rarity''': [overdramatically] You have to forgive me! I don't know what I did or why you're mad at me! Just please say you forgive me! [wailing] Pleeeeeeeease!
:'''Spike''': Of course I forgive you. But, uh, what are you apologizing for?
:[ka-chunk!]
:'''Rarity''': Why does everypony keep harping on that—?! Wait. Don't ''you'' know?
:'''Spike''': No, I'm not mad at you about anything.
:'''Rarity''': B-But... But I don't understand. If you're not upset with me, why in Equestria would you refuse to go to the gem cave?
:'''Spike''': Uh, because I had other plans?
:[clattering]
:'''Gabby''': With me!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]

:'''Rarity''': I don't understand. You two know each other?
:'''Spike''': Gabby and I are sort of pen pals.
:'''Gabby''': Yeah! There was this whole thing where I pretended to get a cutie mark because griffons don't get cutie marks, so Princess Twilight had Spike send a bunch of letters off to Griffonstone about the first griffon ever to get a cutie mark! Which I didn't really have.
:'''Spike''': Gabby wrote back explaining things, and after that we just started writing back and forth.
:'''Gabby''': Turns out we have a lot in common! We both come from cultures that don't have the friendliest of reputations.
:'''Spike''': [slurps] And we're both in the message-sending business!
:'''Gabby''': Uh-huh!
:'''Spike''' and '''Gabby''': [chomp, gulp]
:'''Gabby''': I sure wish I could send scrolls with my breath!
:'''Spike''' and '''Gabby''': [laughing]
:'''Rarity''': [forced laugh] Yes... Now I understand why you didn't come to the gem cave. Having a friend in town is a rare treat. Well, since you're busy today, maybe we can do something tomorrow. Fabric shopping? I know how you love to pick out the colors.
:'''Spike''': Uh, actually, now that there's a griffon at Twilight's school, Gabby's here all the time.
:'''Gabby''': Grampa Gruff asks for a lot of updates about how Gallus is doing. [sighs] Speaking of which, I better get going.
:'''Spike''': I'll fly with you.
:'''Rarity''': Well, all right. You two fly along. I'm sure Spike and I can do something some other—
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': ...time?

:'''Rarity''': I cannot decide which shade of purple is the most royal! And there's the pink! How will I ever choose?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting] Too bad Spike's not here. I bet he could help you narrow it down.
:'''Rarity''': He is a good sounding board, isn't he?
:[muffled thud]
:[curtains close]

:[montage music]

:[camera clicks]
:[bits clinking]

:[door opens]

:[door opens]
:[thud]
:[slurping]

:[sewing machine whirring]
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Could you bring the pincushion a little closer, dear? I suppose now that Spike's always so busy with Gabby, I'm just now realizing how much his presence has meant to me over the years.
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Even closer, darling. I don't want to prick you. I have to admit everything feels a bit "less than" without him. Too close!
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, it's no use. Thank you for trying. I'm just accustomed to the help of a small, highly attentive dragon.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe you should let Spike know how grateful you are for everything he's done for you.

:'''Spike''': [snoring] Aah!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I am sorry, Spike. I didn't mean to frighten you.
:'''Spike''': Rarity? What are you doing here?
:'''Rarity''': Well, I realize it's late. Or rather, early. But I have a surprise, and I just couldn't wait to share it. The Great Gem Crevasse of the Crystal Mountains!
:[click]
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Rarity''': It is only accessible once a year, and I thought a little day trip would make a wonderful thank you for all the help you've given me over the years.
:'''Spike''': Oh. But I'm supposed to meet Gabby today for her rounds.
:'''Rarity''': I see. Well, there's always next year.
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': You know what? I'll just write her a note.
:'''Rarity''': Are you sure?
:'''Spike''': Absolutely.

:[train chugging]
:[train hisses]
:[gems clinking]
:'''Spike''': Wow. Rarity, you weren't kidding. The Gem Crevasse was amazing! I'll be snacking on these for a week.
:'''Rarity''': What did I tell you?
:'''Gabby''': Hey, Spike!
:'''Spike''': Gabby! You won't believe where I went today!
:'''Gabby''': Actually, I think I will. I got your scroll. The Great Gem Crevasse sounds a lot better than doing my rounds.
:'''Spike''': Mm-hmm!
:[gems clinking]
:'''Gabby''': Whoa! It was definitely better! I gotta get back to Griffonstone, but you have to tell me all about the Crevasse tomorrow!
:'''Spike''': Absolutely! [grunts] Thanks again, Rarity. What a great day.

:'''Gabby''': Okay! Start from the beginning, because I want to hear everything!
:'''Spike''': Well, to get to the Crevasse, you have to climb across a rope bridge because the air's too thin to fly!
:'''Gabby''': That is amazing! Then what?!
:[thud]
:'''Gabby''': Whoa!
:'''Spike''': Sorry, Rarity!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, no apology necessary, Spike. In fact, I was just looking for you.
:'''Spike''': You were? Why?
:'''Rarity''': Because I just acquired... these!
:'''Spike''': Passes to Power Ponypalooza!? For today!?
:'''Rarity''': Mm-hmm! I know we just went to the Crevasse, but I feel I've barely scratched the surface of expressing my gratitude for all you do.
:'''Spike''': Uh... of course I want to go, but that'll be two days in a row we haven't hung out.
:'''Gabby''': Nah! Are you kidding? It's Power Ponypalooza! You have to go! And now you'll have ''two'' things to tell me about!
:'''Spike''': Okay! Come on, Rarity! Let's go!

:'''Spike''': Whew! Are my claws sore.
:'''Rarity''': Indeed. I had no idea how much walking there is at a Power Pony convention!
:'''Spike''': [grunting] Aww. I know I told Gabby we'd hang out tomorrow, but I might need the whole day to rest.
:'''Rarity''': Whoo. I know what you mean. Perhaps you could, uh, just send her another note.
:'''Rarity''' and '''Spike''': [grunting]
:'''Spike''': [chuckles] I think maybe you're right.
:'''Rarity''': Honestly, I might need to spend tomorrow putting my hooves up as well. [laughs]
:[door opens]

:[knock on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': I hadn't counted on Power Ponypalooza being quite so draining, but I thought we might spend the day recuperating together.
:'''Spike''': No way! ''Ogres & Oubliettes''?!
:'''Rarity''': Well, I know how much you enjoy it. And this seemed like the perfect opportunity for you to teach me the game.

:[door opens]
:'''Gabby''': [echoing] Spike? I got your note! I figured I'd come by before my rounds with a bowl of energizing turnip soup.
:'''Rarity''' and '''Spike''': [laughter fading in]
:'''Rarity''': Can Princess Shmarity use her Shield of the Coiffure to defend herself from the purveyor of poor color coordination?
:'''Spike''': Oh, she can try... Success! Shmarity's shield holds against the Green-Eyed Monster's attack! And then—!
:'''Gabby''': Spike?
:'''Spike''': Oh, hi, Gabby. We were just—
:'''Gabby''': Your scroll said you were too tired to do anything today. But I guess you were just too tired to do anything with me.
:'''Spike''': No-no-no-no! That's not true! I can come with you on your rounds right now!
:'''Gabby''': I don't think so, Spike. Maybe I'll just handle the rounds on my own from now on.
:[thermos clinking]
:'''Rarity''': Oooh! Princess Shmarity uses her Prismatic Beam to change that poor monster's color to a more pleasing shade of purple!

:'''Rarity''': What do you think, Spike? Solids or prints?
:'''Spike''': [sighs] Prints, I guess. You already have a lot of solid colors.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, you are so right. Prints it is! So nice to have you back, Spike.
:[cash register rings]
:'''Rarity''': Although I hope you're able to reconcile with Gabby.
:'''Spike''': I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to.

:[montage music]

:'''Rarity''': I quite enjoyed our day together today, Spike.
:'''Spike''': Yeah...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hi, Spike.
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm. I've never seen Spike this sad before. Do you know what happened?
:'''Rarity''': [clears throat] Yes, well, perhaps he's still just tired from Power Ponypalooza.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think that's it.
:'''Rarity''': I... suppose... it's possible it could have something to do with... [coughs] Gabby not wanting to spend time with him anymore.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What? I thought the two of them were hanging out all the time.
:'''Rarity''': They were! Honestly, it took everything I had to convince him to spend any time with me at all! But between crystal gem crevasses, Power Pony conventions, and a marathon game of ''O&O'', I managed to get some time in.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It sounds like you made sure he didn't have any time to spend with Gabby at all.
:'''Rarity''': What?! Pfft! I most certainly did not!
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': Well, I... suppose I may have monopolized him a teeny bit. [sighs] I'd just grown so used to having Spikey-Wikey around, I wasn't prepared for how much I'd miss him when he wasn't.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Friendships change, but just because Spike made a new friend doesn't mean he stops being yours.
:'''Rarity''': I know, but now I have to share him! Which I suppose I'll have to get used to. [gasps] Right after I fix the mess I've made!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Good talk.

:'''Gabby''': [sighs]
:[door opens]
:[music playing]
:'''Gabby''': Rarity? Is all this stuff for Spike again? Wouldn't it be easier to just give it to him? And why are you even here?
:'''Rarity''': I am here to apologize. Actually, more to confess. And all of this stuff isn't for Spike. It's the evidence against me!
:'''Gabby''': Evidence? For what?
:'''Rarity''': For my acts of utter selfishness!
:'''Gabby''': I don't understand.
:'''Rarity''': These are items I used to lure Spike into spending as much time with me as possible!
:'''Gabby''': They are? You did?
:'''Spike''': Rarity? What are you doing?
:'''Rarity''': Well, obviously I'm apologizing to Gabby so the two of you can renew your friendship, Spike. Now please, even if you can't forgive me, you simply must forgive— [gasps] Spike?! Oh. I actually owe you an apology, too.
:'''Gabby''': You apologize a lot.
:'''Rarity''': I wish I didn't need to, but the more time you two spent together, the more I missed my time with Spike, and the more I used every means at my disposal to get it back. I am truly sorry.
:'''Spike''': You really miss spending time with me?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, of course!
:'''Gabby''': I have to say, after not hanging out with you, I understand why. You're kinda awesome! And I know what it's like to miss that now, too.
:'''Spike''': So, do you think maybe we could start hanging out again?
:'''Gabby''': Absolutely.
:'''Spike''': I don't suppose you'd like some company on your rounds right now?
:'''Gabby''': I sure would!
:'''Rarity''': Wonderful! I can't tell you how pleased I am that the two of you have— [laughs] ...reconciled.

:[pickaxe clinking]
:'''Rarity''': [whispering] I suppose Twilight is right. Friendships do change.
:[gem shattering]
:[bats squeaking]
:'''Rarity''': [whispering] Of course Spike and I will always be friends, and I can get used to sharing him.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panicked yelping, whispering] Sorry! I just didn't want to drop another one and wake the bats.
:'''Rarity''': [whispering] Darling. Catching the gems is what the basket is for.
:'''Spike''': [whispering] Wow. You two need to be a lot quieter.
:'''Rarity''': Spike! How wonderful to see you!
:'''Spike''': Yeah. Gabby and I had a great day, but I'll always still want my Rarity time.
:[pickaxe clinking]
:[gem shattering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ohhhh! So that's how it works!
:[wings flapping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rarity''', and '''Spike''': [scream]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I think you really spruce up the office, Ms. Philodendron. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna call you Phyllis! [baby talk] Don't you look good, Phyllis!
:[knock on door]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [baby talk] Come in!
:[door opens]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [clears throat] I mean, uh, come in!
:'''Spike''': Uh, were you just talking to someone?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No! Why? [nervous laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight, I have something very important to discuss with you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': If this is about leaving early yesterday, I didn't have any students on my schedule, and Trixie was having a magical emergency, which actually turned out to be nothing—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggles] It's not anything like that.
:'''Spike''': [clears throat, reading] "Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, in light of her impending ascension to the throne of Equestria and in anticipation of her many duties and responsibilities forthwith, does hereby intend to make good on her previous offer to you, Starlight Glimmer, of replacing her as headmare of the School of Friendship!"
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I want you to take over the school when I move to Canterlot.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know! It's just so... amazing! I'm a little... Do you think I'm really up for it? Of course you do. I've covered for you every time you've had to run off and save Equestria, but... I mean... Yes. Of course! Thank you! [squeals]
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [straining] You're welcome. And I can't think of anypony who'd be better for the job.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm a little nervous. And excited. I'm mostly just nervous.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I understand. Of course I'll have a lot of important responsibilities as ruler of Equestria, but I'll always be available to help whenever you need.
:'''Spike''': [gags, belches]
:[poof!]
:'''Spike''': Are you supposed to be at a royal etiquette lesson with Celestia and Luna right now?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right! [sighs] Can't underestimate the important responsibility of royal napkin placement.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow. I mean, no biggie. Right, Phyllis? I've totally got this.
:[shatter!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [nervous laugh]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Trixie''': You know I'm nothing but proud that you've been officially offered the position of headmare...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Thanks...?
:'''Trixie''': ...but I can't help wondering if it's gonna cut into our social schedule.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What do you mean?
:'''Trixie''': Take now, for example. Instead of heading to the delightful lunch I had planned, we're striding with determination toward what I can only assume is Twilight's office.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Obviously our lunch is super important, but so is taking over the school. And the only pony who's really ''run'' the School of Friendship is the ''Princess'' of Friendship. And I'm worried about doing it all alone, so I want to get as much advice from Twilight as I can while she's still here.
:'''Trixie''': But Twilight's never really done anything alone. She always has her friends.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But that just gave me an idea! Thanks, Trixie! You can give good advice when you don't mean to.
:'''Trixie''': Uh, thanks? Are we still doing lunch?

:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Getting royal place settings just right is a lot harder than it looks.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay... Uh, I know how busy you are, but I wanted to talk to you about running the school because, honestly, I was a bit worried about taking it over all on my own. But I just realized ''you'' never did it alone.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Having a friend help out is pretty great.
:[magic humming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Exactly! So, what do you think about me hiring a vice headmare to help run things?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I trust you to run the school any way you want. And if that means hiring a vice headmare, I think it's a great idea.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Like you said, I've always had ponies around to help. And don't worry. You can always call on me to—
:'''Spike''': Uh, Twilight? Rarity says you were supposed to be at the boutique five minutes ago for your second fitting for the coronation gown.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ugh. How many fittings are there gonna be?
:'''Spike''': A lot?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Anyway, good luck finding your vice headmare. I know you'll pick the right pony for the job.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Trixie''': Wow. I heard the whole thing. And all I can say is I am humbled.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, why?
:'''Trixie''': I hadn't ever considered it, but hearing you say it out loud made me realize what a great and powerful vice headmare I'll be! Plus, we get to work ''and'' socialize at the same time!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, well, sure, that would be fun, but I can't just give you the job.
:'''Trixie''': Oh, oh, no, of course not. I imagine there's a lengthy "process" to go through before you inevitably hire the "best pony" for the position. Wink.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Exactly. I'll probably interview several ponies.
:'''Trixie''': Of course. "Several". Wink.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Why do you keep saying "wink"?
:'''Trixie''': I'm not saying "wink". Wink.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [nervous laugh]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm glad you all decided to be a part of the search for the School of Friendship's vice headmare.
:'''Spoiled Rich''': Honestly, if you're looking for somepony to fund-raise, I can bring in enough bits to have several buildings named after me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, that's not the primary responsibility of the vice headmare. But anypony is welcome to apply. I think the selection process I've come up with is pretty special.
:'''Trixie''': [whispering] Albeit unnecessary. Wink!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [clears throat] Since you all have to prove you have what it takes to be vice headmare, I've designed the interview in three stages. Each stage will test a different skill the vice headmare needs. Only those who do well will move through the stages until finally the best candidate rises to the top! So, without further ado, it's time for stage one – substituting for the teachers!
:'''All but Starlight Glimmer''': [excited murmuring]
:'''Trixie''': Once the students get a sample of my great and powerful instruction, they might not want to go back to the regular faculty.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]

:'''Ocellus''': Wow, that seam is so straight! You really learned how to sew from mending apple sacks on the farm?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup!

:'''Spoiled Rich''': Obviously, loyalty is the foundation of friendship and trust. But nothing gets more loyalty than a big stack of bits! This book on business will teach you all how to earn your own. Chapter one – Equity...

:[bass guitar sounds]
:[students laughing]

:[bubbling]
:[balloon inflating]
:[fan whirring]
:[snip!]
:[drip!]
:[sounds of awe, cheering]

:'''Trixie''': In the Pre-Equestia Era, year thirteen twenty-two, Abraxius the Bold did... [muttering] ...ooh, a bunch of boring stuff... [muttering] ...for a really long time. Okay, I know history is important, but I never learned any of it, and look how I turned out.
:[students groaning, yawning]
:'''Gallus''': [snoring]

:[students snoring]
:'''Trixie''': [whispering] Wink! [snoring]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay, Phyllis. Obviously those three are moving on. But what about the rest? Mm-hmm. I think we're in agreement on this one. [sighs] I know what you're gonna say. But it would be so much fun to have my vice headmare be a friend. She just needs a little more hoof-holding than some of the others, but it could still work out, right?
:[door opens]
:'''Trixie''': Starlight, I've given this a lot of thought. And even though I still believe naps are a valid use of class time, ''you'll'' be the one running the school. So if you say no naps, then no naps! And I know I can be a little stubborn and not the best listener, but I just can't wait for us to tackle this job as a team. Two great and powerful friends taking on the world! And I know you still have to go through all this "interview" stuff – wink! – but I just had to tell you how excited I am!
:[door closes]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': See? I told you it could work. [groans]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': All right, remaining vice headmare candidates. Welcome to stage two! All of you are here because you performed well – or well enough – to face your next challenge – parent/teacher conferences! The vice headmare will need to be a master communicator, and I can't think of a better test of that than meeting with our students and their parents or guardians.
:'''Dr. Hooves''': I eagerly look forward to sharing my love of science with both progeny and progenitors!
:'''Octavia Melody''': Indeed. An orchestra is made up of different parts, and good communication is the key to harmony.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Trixie''': A lifetime on stage has taught me that good communication is essential to holding your audience's attention, which is why Trixie is also known as a great and powerful communicator!

:'''Octavia Melody''': Life at the School of Friendship is like a song, and although she started out singing her part pianissimo, Ocellus is now soloing fortissimo!
:'''Dad Changeling''': That's good, right?
:'''Octavia Melody''': [nervous laugh] Indeed.
:'''Dr. Hooves''': The science curriculum at this school is somewhat lacking, but Yona has taken to the subject like a yak to smashing! If fostered, I believe she could easily blaze a trail and expand our understanding of science itself!
:'''Yona's Mom''' and '''Yona's Dad''': Yaks best! Yaks best! Yaks best!
:'''Trixie''': Gallus is a fantastic student. He's even taught me a thing or two about napping.
:'''Grampa Gruff''': [yawns] Is that why you're putting ''me'' to sleep?
:'''Trixie''': Um, excuse me?
:'''Grampa Gruff''': I don't know why I have to come to these things.
:'''Trixie''': Well, most parents or guardians want to be involved in our students' lives. Maybe we should find a different representative from Griffonstone to be Gallus' guardian.
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Oh, that'd be great. If you find one, [echoing] ''let me know!''
:'''Sky Beak''': I'm so confused. You're saying Silverstream is exuberant?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Sky Beak''': ''And'' enthusiastic?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Uh, eeyup.
:'''Sky Beak''': But aren't those the same? And are they good? I mean, you could be trying to tell me she's unfocused, but then you might just be explaining that you appreciate her high energy.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eh, nope. Uh, eeyup. Uh... mmmaybe?
:'''Sky Beak''': There seems to be a lot of nuance here, and I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you're saying. So what are you saying?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Uh...
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Gallus doesn't need to know I'm proud of him! And he certainly doesn't need me trekking all the way to Ponyville!
:'''Trixie''': Good! Because you're no longer welcome!
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Ohhhh! Well, fine with me!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, what happened?!
:'''Trixie''': I'm not sure. But we'll have one less conference to worry about next semester.
:[smack!]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I really appreciate your honesty, Big Mac, and you're right. Parents expect a lot of detailed communication when it comes to their kids. And if you aren't comfortable with that, vice headmare probably isn't the job for you.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Yeah, nope.
:[door opens]
:'''Trixie''': Starlight, I know why you wanted to see me, and you don't have to worry.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, good.
:'''Trixie''': It's thoughtful that you'd want to check in on me after my shocking confrontation with Grampa Gruff. But never fear. I shall recover.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, that's not exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. You can't get into a shouting match with parents or guardians. For the final stage of the interview process, you'll each have to put together a field trip. And if you really do want the job, I need yours to be exceptional. Because if I had to pick a vice headmare right now, it wouldn't be you.
:'''Trixie''': Oh, I see what you're doing! Obviously you're not going to give the job to somepony else, but you want to see my best. Well, message received! Wink.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] Trixie, I—
:'''Trixie''': The Great and Powerful Trixie is about to pull out all the stops! I hope you're ready for the most exceptional field trip to ever grace this school!
:[poof!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Is it wrong for me to think she might actually pull it off?
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] Don't answer that.

:'''Gallus''': [yawns]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Not looking forward to the performance?
:'''Gallus''': I know Octavia loves music, but a field trip to a classical music performance isn't my idea of an exciting time.
:[dubstep cello]
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Gallus''': Okay! I take it back!

:'''Dr. Hooves''': When I heard we'd be arranging field trips, I knew right away I wanted to take you all to my lab. I can think of no better trip than one through the quantum field! I am referring to time travel! I've been working on a temporal transportation device!
:'''Smolder''': A chair?
:'''Dr. Hooves''': And three... four... five... Congratulations! You are now five seconds into the future! You see, we are all already time travelers! Hmm? Who's next?
:[beat]
:'''Smolder''': Uhhh, now what?
:'''Dr. Hooves''': Oh. I actually hadn't thought that much beyond this.
:'''Smolder''': Ugh.

:[poof!]
:'''Trixie''': [coughs, clears throat] Ponies and other students! Welcome to the greatest and most powerful field trip of your lives!
:'''Yona''': Where Yona and friends going?
:'''Trixie''': I am thrilled you asked. Because today we're not doing a normal, old, boring field trip where you ''go'' somewhere.
:'''Yona''': So... not field trip.
:'''Trixie''': Au contraire. I could have easily taken you to Froggy Bottom Bogg. But we don't need to leave the comfort of the classroom for our field trip. I can bring the field trip to us!
:[teleportation zap]
:[crash!]
:[students gasp]
:[crack!]
:[electric sounds]
:[flash bees buzzing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, what did you do?!
:'''Trixie''': Well, I found the perfect little patch of bog to teleport into the school. I guess I just didn't consider the possibility that a hive of flash bees might have nested there.
:[zap!]

:[flash bees buzzing]
:[students yelling]
:'''Trixie''': [yelping] Who told you bees to nest in my patch of field trip bog?!
:[poofing]
:[electric sounds]
:[students yelling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, go with the students! I'll handle this!
:'''Trixie''': I was only trying to give them an exceptional field trip experience! Which you have to admit I did.
:[flash bees buzzing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': Aah!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We'll talk about it later!
:[magic sounds]
:[boom!]
:'''Trixie''': Um, Starlight?
:[clattering]
:'''Trixie''': Hey, there. So, um, they're gone?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [bitterly] Yes.
:'''Trixie''': Nice! Teamwork, am I right?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Are you kidding? I don't know what team ''you're'' on, but it isn't mine. This was a disaster. It was dangerous.
:'''Trixie''': I think the words you're looking for are "great and powerful".
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It wasn't even acceptable! You went from not taking it seriously to blowing things so out of proportion you put everycreature in danger! And I wanted to work with a friend so much, I ignored the fact that you would never be right for the job!
:'''Trixie''': I'm confused. What are you saying?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm saying you'll never be vice headmare!
:'''Trixie''': But... But I thought you created the position for me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Why would you think that?! I created the position because I need ''help''! But I can't think of any way that you would ever help me!
:'''Trixie''': Twilight's friends always helped her.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh-ho. That's because Twilight's friends are competent! They care about what they are doing! ''And'' they know how to do it!
:'''Trixie''': Well, I guess I won't take up any more of your time, Headmare Starlight.
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Starlight? I just thought I'd check in to see how the search for a vice headmare was going.
:[magic sounds]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': A lot better now.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I really wanted it to be a friend, so I ended up pushing aside some pretty big signs that it wasn't gonna work out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not everypony is right for every job, but everypony has something to contribute. The trick is figuring out what.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What if you and your friend can't figure it out?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If you have a job to do, you have to decide what's best and be upfront and honest, even if that means you can't work with a friend on it.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So, I guess that means talking to them at the beginning instead of stringing them along until you get so frustrated you totally lose it and say a bunch of really awful things?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pretty much.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs]

:[knock on door]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie? I know you're in there.
:'''Trixie''': Well, you're wrong!
:[clatter!]
:'''Trixie''': [coughing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm sorry for all those things I said. I just really wanted it to work out, even though I knew it probably wouldn't. I should have said something sooner.
:'''Trixie''': Obviously we can't have what we want, because I'm terrible at everything and could never help you with anything!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You aren't terrible. And you have a lot of great qualities. Maybe not vice headmare qualities, but great and powerful friend qualities.
:[door opens]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, you really stand by the ponies you care about. Gallus even said nocreature's ever stuck up for him the way you did with Grampa Gruff. It would have been nice to run the school together, but not everypony is right for every job.
:'''Trixie''': I know how you take your responsibilities seriously. And maybe I should've known I wasn't exactly a perfect fit.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': If it makes you feel any better, nopony was.
:'''Trixie''': What do you mean?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, Dr. Hooves has decided to go back to his experiments, and Octavia is worried the responsibilities of vice headmare will take too much time away from her music. Maybe getting a vice headmare was a bad idea.
:'''Trixie''': Starlight, obviously you'd like some help, and hiring a vice headmare ''is'' a great idea.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But who could it be?
:'''Trixie''': Well, you need somepony who's responsible like you and detail-oriented like Twilight. And... smart, obviously. It is a school after all.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It would be nice if I got along with them, since having it be a friend can't work out.
:'''Trixie''': Maybe it can.
:[poof!]

:'''Sunburst''': ...And I knew as soon as I read Trixie's scroll that it was the exact right thing for me to do.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But what about being Flurry Heart's Crystaller?
:'''Sunburst''': Well, honestly, now that Flurry Heart's a little older, there really isn't much for me to do outside of the occasional tradition or festival. And working at a school is what I always thought I'd do. I mean, if you'll have me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Are you kidding?! You're hired!
:'''Trixie''': I had a feeling this would work out.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, Trixie, thank you so much.
:'''Trixie''': Between being insightful when I want to be and giving good advice when I don't mean to, I suppose I can be a pretty good friend.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': More than that, actually. You really did give good advice. And you helped me talk through the problem of finding the right pony for the job. And we know you care about the students.
:'''Trixie''': Trixie the Great and Powerful Advice Giver, Problem Talk-Through-er, and Student Care-About-er! Eh, I think I'll go with "friend".
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': "Friend" is perfect. But there's a position here at the school you might be right for, too. What would you say to being the School of Friendship's new student counselor?
:'''Trixie''': I'd say this office needs a bit of redecorating. Potted plants scream desperation.
:[thud]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ''Phyllis, no!''

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:[knock on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! I just stopped by to thank you for letting me borrow your ''Daring Do'' books. I love them!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait 'til you get to ''Daring Do and the Riddle of the Sphinx''!
:'''Fluttershy''': This is actually my second time through! I read them all! From ''Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue'' to ''Daring Do and the Fallen Idol''!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''Fallen Idol''? That's not in the series.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. It just came out last week. Maybe that's why you haven't heard of it?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No way Daring Do's biggest fan – me – would miss a book coming out! Besides, A. K. Yearling always sends me a copy.
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, I'm happy to let you borrow mine until yours arrives.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [reading] "The true story of the thieving fraud known as Daring Do"?! What?! Why would A. K. Yearling write that about herself?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh. It looks like she didn't. This book says it's by Groom Q. Q. Martingale.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who?
:'''Fluttershy''': I guess he's a new writer.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': A ''bad'' one. [reading] "The only thing worse than Daring Do's destruction of temples is her cruelty to the mild-mannered Dr. Caballeron"?!
:'''Fluttershy''': It was written from his point of view. I figured it was an artistic choice.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': More like a disaster! Listen! [reading] "Daring Do isn't just a fictional character from over-the-top adventure stories. I've met her, and she is a real, live pony!" That's supposed to be a secret! [grunts] We're the only ones who know Daring Do is really A. K. Yearling in disguise. But if other ponies read this book, how long will it take them to figure that out?! We have to go warn her! ''Fluttershy!''
:'''Fluttershy''': Hm? Oh. Sorry.

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Rainbow Dash''': A. K. Yearling is signing all her books at the bookstore today. We can warn her about what's going on.
:'''Fluttershy''': Don't you think you should read Martingale's book first? Just to hear both sides of the story?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, why? The only true thing in that pack of lies is that Daring Do is real.
:'''Fluttershy''': There's also a lot of insight into Dr. Caballeron's life choices. Did you know he's actually a history professor and amateur bird watcher?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Are you serious right now? A random writer trashes our friend and exposes her secret, and you want to talk about birds?!
:'''Fluttershy''': [whispers] Also spider cruelty.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?!
:'''Fluttershy''': You have to admit Daring Do wrecks a lot of spider webs in her adventures.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': In order to save precious artifacts from the bad guy, who you seem to have forgotten is Dr. Caballeron! Are you sure you read the same series I did?

:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, at least A. K. Yearling's true fans know Martingale's book is bogus.
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm not sure those are all fans.
:[slam!]
:'''Pony 1''': Why didn't your books say Daring Do was real? This changes everything!
:'''Pony 2''': And why do you only write about her good side? Is she bribing you?
:'''Pony 1''': On page five-thirty-one, it says that Daring Do kicks puppies!
:'''"Peach Fuzz"''': She does?!
:'''A. K. Yearling''': What?! No! Look, are any of you here for my actual book signing?
:[ponies muttering negatively]
:'''Pony 2''': Uh-uh. Frankly, I don't even know how you can call it fiction if it's all real. [scoffs] You're as much a fake as Daring Do!
:[ponies agreeing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I... guess we're a little late to warn you about the new book, huh?
:'''A. K. Yearling''': [sighs] I always feared that someday everypony would learn Daring Do was real.
:'''Fluttershy''': But why? Aren't you proud of your adventures?
:'''A. K. Yearling''': Of course, but I'm not in it for the fame. The stories just seemed too good to keep to myself. I wish I knew who this Martingale author was and why he's determined to ruin my character. And me.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe we can ask him.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No way! He's doing a signing across the street?!
:'''A. K. Yearling''': You'd better go without me. I can't risk the chance Martingale might recognize me as Daring Do.

:[indistinct chatter]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oops. Um, sorry. E-Excuse us.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] That's not Martingale! It's Dr. Caballeron in disguise! Now it all makes sense! Daring Do's archnemesis created a fake author self so he can write books that make him sound like a hero! Who does that?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Uh, A. K. Yearling?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This is totally different. [to Dr. Caballeron] Well, well, well! Up to your old tricks again, huh? Just like in Somnambula! Spreading lies to make Daring Do look bad!
:'''Fluttershy''': Would you sign our book?
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': I am just a simple author telling it like it is. Who should I make it out to?
:'''Fluttershy''': Fluttershy. With two "T"'s.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] We know who you really are! And unless you want us to tell all of them, you'd better answer some questions!
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': I'm afraid that's all we have time for today. [chuckles]
:'''Ponies''': Awwww...
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': But please take a free copy of my book on your way out.
:'''Ponies''': [cheering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We aren't gonna let you get away with this, Caballeron!
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': Get away with what? I am merely telling my side of the story.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You mean lying!
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': You think everything in A. K. Yearling's books are true? In ''Daring Do and the Quetzal's Quest'', she states that the Fangthorn Flowers are red when in fact they are blue!
:'''Fluttershy''': It's true. They are.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] That sounds like more of an editor's mistake.
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': Still, if that is wrong, is it not possible that other, bigger things are, too? Take a look. It's in my book.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But I don't have to take ''your'' word for it! C'mon, Fluttershy!
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': [sighs dramatically]
:'''Fluttershy''': Is something wrong?
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': It is terrible being misunderstood. It is true in the past I have not been as nice to Daring Do as I should. But I have my reasons!
:'''Fluttershy''': Want to talk about what happened?
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': My team and I were only ever interested in researching artifacts and taking them to our museum where...

:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': [narrating] ...other ponies could study them. But Daring Do always seemed to get there first with her own plans. I offered to team up with her, but she refused. She had her own ideas of where the treasures belonged.

:'''Fluttershy''': Daring Do did have a lot of artifacts on her shelves at home. But didn't you try to sell them to the highest bidder?
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': Only because I had to.

:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': [narrating] Since Daring Do kept taking our artifacts, our museum closed. We were desperate for money to keep it open.
:'''Ahuizotl''': [roars]

:'''Fluttershy''': She does destroy a lot of ancient sites. Not to mention the homes of the animals that live there.
:'''Groom Q. Q. Martingale''': And I felt it was my duty to tell the world. Thank you for listening and understanding, Miss...
:'''Fluttershy''': Fluttershy. Two "T"'s.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': And I am Dr. Caballeron. "Martingale" is merely a ''nom de plume'' to build my brand. You know, my team could use an insightful Pegasus like you, Fluttershy. Have you ever thought of being... an adventurer?
:'''Fluttershy''': Who, me?

:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Finally! What took you so long?
:'''Fluttershy''': I decided to find out which author is really telling the truth, so I joined Dr. C's Tenochtitlan expedition!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Say whaaaaaaat?!

:'''"Peach Fuzz"''': So Daring Do doesn't kick puppies?
:'''A. K. Yearling''': That was one time! Accidentally!
:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panting] A. K.! You have to help me! Groom Q. Q. Martingale is really Dr. Caballeron, and he has Fluttershy! The book thing was his new plan to ruin Daring Do's reputation, ''and'' he's trying to make my friend a criminal! They're off to Tenochtitlan right now!
:'''A. K. Yearling''': He must be after the Truth Talisman of Tonatiuh! It requires the wings of a Pegasus to retrieve it!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's gotta be why Caballeron tricked Fluttershy into joining his gang!
:'''A. K. Yearling''': Then it's up to us to stop him!
:[cloak flaps]
:'''"Peach Fuzz"''': Whooooaaaa!

:[crunch]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Watch where you put your hooves, everypony. We do not want to disturb the fragile jungle ecosystem.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, that's so thoughtful.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Yes, unlike Daring Do, who slashes plants aside with her cruel machete.
:'''Fluttershy''': Thank you.
:[crunch!]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Fool! Don't you know that's poison?!
:[beat]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': I... don't want you to get hurt, my friend. [nervous chuckle]
:'''Rogue''': But I'm hungry.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! I can help with that! Here!
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': You are... willing to share?
:'''Fluttershy''': Of course! That's part of the fun of having an adventure with friends!
:[munching and sipping]
:[bushes rustle]
:[jaguar roars]
:[lynx yowls]
:[cheetah growls]
:'''Fluttershy''', '''Dr. Caballeron''', and '''henchponies''': [gasp]
:[white cat yowls]
:[screech!]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Fluttershy! Run! These ferocious beasts want to eat us for dinner!
:'''Fluttershy''': That's a common misconception. Have you ever tried just talking to them?
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': That's crazy! You are on your own!
:'''Withers''': She's a goner.
:'''Biff''': I can't watch!
:[jungle cats purring]
:'''Fluttershy''': We're very sorry for coming into your territory. We're just passing through.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': How did you do that?
:'''Fluttershy''': Everycreature likes to be listened to. You just need to take the time to understand them.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': You are more talented than I realized.
:'''Fluttershy''': Thanks. I'm having the best time with you all!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fluttershy must be having the worst time with Caballeron's goons!
:'''Daring Do''': We need to catch up to them before they reach the Truth Talisman!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Why? What's so special about it?
:'''Daring Do''': It has the power to make the pony holding it tell the truth. But Caballeron only wants it because it's made of solid gold. He'll melt it down and use it to get rich.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So if this Talisman is so important, why didn't you already save it? You said only a Pegasus can get it, right?
:'''Daring Do''': Yes, but the temple traps are far too dangerous to face without a map. And maybe even ''with'' one.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gulps]

:'''Biff''': Boss, how about we take the shortcut?
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': How about you be quiet?!
:[beat]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': I-I mean... no, thank you, Biff. Let's just follow the map.
:'''Biff''': Aww. I'm supposed to be Dr. C's second-in-command. But he never listens to me.
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, keep trying. I believe in you.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': At last! Now we simply have to wait for the sun to reach its highest point, and our path will be revealed.
:[fly-ders buzzing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Withers. Don't. Move.
:[zip!]
:[flute sounds]
:'''Withers''': [cheers]

:'''Daring Do''': There they are! We can catch them before they enter the temple!
:[vines snap]
:'''Daring Do''': [yelps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]
:'''Daring Do''': Get back, Rainbow Dash! It's Ahuizotl!
:[vines snap]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts]
:'''Ahuizotl''': [laughs evilly] Daring Do, my old nemesis. You may have outsmarted my jungle cats, but you cannot escape me!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts] We didn't see any cats! We're just here to rescue Fluttershy!
:'''Ahuizotl''': Hmmm... It must be a coincidence that only a Pegasus can retrieve Tonatiuh's treasure, and there are two of you here.
:[slam!]
:[zip!]
:'''Ahuizotl''': [roars]

:[grinding]
:[magic sounds]
:[rumbling]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Quickly! Before the sun moves and it closes!
:[rumbling]
:[thud]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Phew! That was cutting it close.
:'''Daring Do''': And without a map, we'll have to guess which way to go.

:[rumbling]
:[shimmering]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': [overdramatically] Oh, no! I knew the Truth Talisman could not be moved by magic, but I never realized we'd have to fly to retrieve it! Our journey has been for nothing!
:'''Fluttershy''': Don't be upset. I can get it.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Oh, Fluttershy, you are too kind. But I could never ask that of you. It might be dangerous!
:'''Fluttershy''': I want to do it! For all of you, my new friends. And to protect a historical treasure!
:[rumbling]
:'''Fluttershy''': [screaming] Whoa!
:'''Biff''': [grunts] Give me a hoof here!
:'''Withers''': [grunting]
:[cracking]
:[thud!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [yelping] Aah!
:[lava bubbling]
:[rumbling]
:'''Withers''': We did it!
:'''Rogue''': You're safe!
:'''Fluttershy''': Thanks, everypony.
:'''Daring Do''': Give us the Talisman, Caballeron!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We're not taking  no for an answer!
:'''Fluttershy''': Wait! You don't understand! My friends are researchers! They only want to study the Talisman and keep it safe in a museum! Right, Dr. C?
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Uhhh... no.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] But... But you said—
:'''Daring Do''': Now that he's holding Tonatiuh's Talisman, he has to tell the truth!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Admit it, Caballeron! You're only pretending to like Fluttershy because she has the wings you needed to steal the Truth Talisman! Isn't that right?!
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': No! I admit that was the original reason, but my henchponies and I have come to value your friendship and kindness.
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Didn't see that coming.
:[rumbling]
:'''Ahuizotl''': [growls]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Or that!
:'''Ahuizotl''': More intruders? And you dare to steal Tonatiuh's Talisman?! Guardian-goyles, attack!
:[shimmering]
:[guardian-goyles growl]
:'''Ahuizotl''': [laughs evilly]
:[thud!]
:[guardian-goyle roars]

:[guardian-goyles growling]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Fluttershy! Can't you ask them to stop like the jungle cats?
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, excuse me? Uh, guardian-goyles?
:[guardian-goyle growls]
:'''Daring Do''': It's no good! They're only stone and magic, not alive! I encountered some like this in Marapore!
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Ah, yes. I seem to recall similar creations in Flankladesh.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So? How do you get rid of them?!
:[chomp!]
:'''Daring Do''': I know they don't like bright light!
:'''Fluttershy''': There's none of that in here.
:'''Daring Do''': Not yet! Caballeron! Do you still have the Diamond of Lapis Lux?
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': Yes! I-I mean... [straining] Yes! I-I mean—! [growls] How did you know I stole it?!
:'''Daring Do''': Lucky guess. Hold it high!
:[guardian-goyles growl]
:[cracking]
:'''Fluttershy''': Wow! You two make a great team!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about that.
:'''Daring Do''': Feel later! Now it's time to escape!
:[thudding]
:'''Biff''': If we want to get out of here, we're all gonna have to work together.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': That's... actually a good idea.
:'''Fluttershy''': See? Told you he'd listen.
:'''Daring Do''': A truce until we escape? How can we trust you?
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': I cannot lie. Now, all together!
:'''All''': [grunting]
:[thud!]

:'''Ahuizotl''': [humming] Aah! You again! [growls] If I wanted to play games, I would get out my pinochle deck!
:'''Daring Do''': This way!
:[whooshing]
:'''Daring Do''': Rainbow Dash!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm gonna need the deluxe spa package after this adventure. That doesn't leave this temple!
:'''Rogue''': That's it! I'm quitting the henchpony business to finally follow my dreams of becoming an opera star!
:[beat]
:'''Rogue''': Uh... maybe you should hold this.
:[slam!]
:'''Ahuizotl''': You cannot hide in there forever! It's a dead end! [laughs evilly, grunting]
:'''Daring Do''': Ahuizotl won't give up until he catches us.
:'''Ahuizotl''': [grunts]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] I think our problem is the solution.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, did you forget there's a monster out there that wants to crush us?
:'''Fluttershy''': But why? Nopony ever asked Ahuizotl what ''his'' side of the story is. He must have a reason for being so upset.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Or maybe he's just the bad guy! Do I need to remind you he's tried to squash Daring Do like a hundred times?!
:[slam!]
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': And me as well. I was so scared, I had to change my ascot. Aah! Curse this truth teller!
:'''Fluttershy''': Understanding begins with listening.
:'''Ahuizotl''': [growls] Prepared to meet your doom?
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, not really. Just here to ask – why are you chasing us, Mr. Ahuizotl?
:'''Ahuizotl''': Well... the thing is, I'm in charge of protecting this jungle. If another artifact goes missing on my watch, I'm going to be in so much trouble with the other guardian creatures.
:'''Fluttershy''': Awww. That sounds like a lot of responsibility.
:'''Ahuizotl''': [stammers] It is! And those two have taken so many relics from my land, my job is on the line! So... maybe I am a little violent and ferocious. Can you blame me? [blows nose]
:'''Daring Do''': The only reason I've been taking the artifacts is because I thought I was protecting them.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': I was stealing them to get rich. But I never realized you had a noble cause. I thought you were just being a monster.
:'''Ahuizotl''': [sighs] I get that a lot.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Maybe there ''is'' something to this whole listening-to-everypony thing.
:'''Fluttershy''': It doesn't always mean they're telling the truth, but everycreature deserves kindness.
:'''Ahuizotl''': True. And because you returned the Talisman and took the time to understand me, I will let you all go.
:[rumbling]
:'''Ahuizotl''': On one condition! You swear to never steal artifacts from the Tenochtitlan Basin again!
:'''Daring Do''' and '''Dr. Caballeron''': I promise.
:'''Daring Do''': I'll even write that in my next book.
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': ''Your'' next book? You mean you're actually A. K. Yearling?
:'''Daring Do''': Don't tell anypony!
:'''Dr. Caballeron''': That gives me an idea.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, what's going on? I thought your first co-written novel would bring out a ton of fans.
:'''A. K. Yearling''': We've been upstaged by a new author.

:'''Ahuizotl''': And so, the noble Ahuizotl bravely toiled day and night to protect the jungle's precious artifacts...

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:'''Apple Bloom''': I can't believe we're goin' to the Appleloosa County Fair!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Animal shows, carnival rides...
:'''Scootaloo''': And all kinds of food on a stick! [slurps]
:[thud]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Speaking of food, did you pack snacks for the train?
:'''Scootaloo''': For there and back.
:'''Apple Bloom''': And our train tickets are all set.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': And I've got our whole itinerary planned!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Are you sure you're not Twilight's sister?
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Scootaloo''': [laugh]
:'''Scootaloo''': Weeks of planning has all come down to this. All we have to do now is wait for our chaperone to get here.
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': Mm-hmm!
:[pause]
:'''Apple Bloom''': So when's Rainbow Dash comin'?
:'''Scootaloo''': I thought you were gonna ask Applejack.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [to Sweetie Belle] I don't suppose you asked Rarity?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You mean we spent all this time planning a trip, and none of us asked anypony to take us?!
:'''Scootaloo''': In our defense, every other part of the trip was planned really well.
:[clatter]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Sweetie Belle''': We really did think of everything except finding somepony to take us, and the fair is only today!
:'''Rarity''': I'm sorry, darlings, but I can't possibly go to Appleloosa. I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Can't you finish it tomorrow?
:[smack!]
:'''Rarity''': Well, I could. But you'll learn as you get older how important it is to keep your promises, especially when running a business.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Maybe we should just go by ourselves?
:'''Rarity''': What?! Oh, my dear, no! Appleloosa is far too long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment. You could end up in the wrong place entirely. Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is free?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sorry, but I just heard from Spitfire that a whole bunch of storm clouds got loose from the cloud factory, and she needs every Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.
:'''Scootaloo''': Aw, come on, Rainbow Dash! They won't miss one pony! And we really want to go to the fair! Apparently we're too young to go alone.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, duh. Young ponies like you could get lost and never find your way back. But I still can't go. Being a Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off. It's also a responsibility. You'll understand when you get older. I'm sure you'll find somepony else to take you.

:'''Applejack''': I wish I could, sugarcube. But Big Mac's not feelin' well today.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Awww. But Big Mac's old enough to take care of himself, and we'd all have so much fun together.
:'''Applejack''': Sometimes takin' care of somepony is more important than havin' fun. Speakin' of which, don't you even think about tryin' to go without a grown pony there to take care of you. You could end up in hot water or worse.
:'''Apple Bloom''': We know.

:'''Scootaloo''': The fair could be over before we find somepony to take us.
:'''Apple Bloom''': But then we thought of you, since the fair will be full of all sorts of animals and creatures.
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm sorry, but Twilight has an important magical research project, and she's asked for my help.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I guess that means Twilight's busy, too?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm afraid I am. Star Swirl sent me this enchanted flower, and it isn't doing well. If I figure out its magical properties, maybe we can save it.
:'''Scootaloo''': So that's a "no" on going with us to the fair?
:'''Apple Bloom''': We've already asked Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity, and none of them can come.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': And everypony made it clear we're too young to go on our own.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, definitely. You could take the wrong train or miss your stop...
:'''Fluttershy''': Or get lost in a strange town and end up in a dangerous situation with nopony to help you.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': We know!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know it's hard, but sometimes you just can't do what you want.
:'''Scootaloo''': I'm pretty sure if ''you'' wanted to go to the fair, you could.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sure, grown-ups can do a lot of things that foals can't. But there's plenty we can't do either. Like right now, I can't find a single reference to this flower!
:'''Fluttershy''': None of the birds or insects I've talked to have heard of it either.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I wonder if there's anything in Shadetail Evergreen's ''Tome of Flora and Fauna''?
:'''Fluttershy''': That book's pretty out of date, but it might be worth a try.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think there's a copy in the library filed under "Discontinued But Still Potentially Useful Ancient Texts". Unless I put it under "Hokum With a Slight Chance of Practical Applications".
:'''Apple Bloom''': I guess this flower is the most interestin' thing we're gonna see today.
:'''Scootaloo''': Unless you count watching Twilight struggle to remember how she organizes her books.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I bet every pony in Equestria is in Appleloosa right now.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Every pony but us.
:'''Scootaloo''': I wish we didn't have to wait to grow up.
:[magic sounds]
:'''Apple Bloom''': I wish it would happen all at once. Then we'd know everything we need to get to the fair and back with no problem.
:[louder magic sounds]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I just wish we were as old as our sisters. Then nopony could tell us what to do, and we'd be able to take care of ourselves.
:[even louder magic sounds]
:'''Scootaloo''': Hey, Sweetie Belle, why's your face all lit up?
:[high-pitched humming]
:[zap!]
:[whooshing]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [whimpering]
:[whooshing stops]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [groan]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [gasps]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [gasps]
:'''Scootaloo''': [gasps]
:[shatter!]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [gasp]
:'''Scootaloo''': Do you know what this means?
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': We can go to the fair! [laugh]

:'''Scootaloo''': [laughing]
:'''Apple Bloom''': I hope you brought the tickets. We've gotta hurry if we're going to make the train.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I think we'll be fine. Check out how fast we're going! Grown-up legs are strong!
:'''Scootaloo''': You're not kidding!
:[rattling]
:'''Scootaloo''': I don't know how much of this my scooter can take!
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Apple Bloom''': And nopony yelled at us to slow down even once! Being a grown-up is great!

:[pocketwatch ticking]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [panting]
:[train whistle blows]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [sigh]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We made it!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Of course we did! We're grown-up ponies now! We can do anything! And all those worries Twilight and the others had don't apply anymore. Because we're big! And bein' big is all it takes!
{{#lst:Being Big is All It Takes|song}}

:[train chugging]
:[brakes hiss]
:[train chugging]
:'''Scootaloo''': I think I ate too many snacks.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Uh, this doesn't look like Appleloosa.
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': That's because it isn't...
:[creaking]
:'''Apple Bloom''': You all heard that, right?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Uh, hello? [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] Do you think we got on the wrong train?
:'''Scootaloo''': I thought trains just took you where you wanted to go.
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': [laughing]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [scream]
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. But you three must not travel much. This is Hayseed Junction. The train to Appleloosa isn't for a few hours. Or you could set off on hoof. It's treacherous and confusing! Unfit for the young or timid! But you three are grown-ups. You'll be fine. I'll write down some directions.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Maybe we should wait for the train.
:'''Scootaloo''': And miss the fair?!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We already ended up in the wrong place, which is exactly what we were warned about. And what if we can't follow the directions?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Come on. We didn't come all this way for nothin'. Besides, I've been through a swamp as a young pony. As a grown-up, it'll be a snap.
:'''Scootaloo''': Grown-ups always know the way!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Because being big is all it takes!
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': [laughs maniacally, hacks, inhales] Sorry. I've got kind of a throat thing.

:[montage music]

:[splash]
:[bufogren croaks]
:'''Scootaloo''': Aah!
:[splash]

:[vines stretch, recoil]

:[bubbling]

:[splashing]
:'''Scootaloo''': Sweetie Belle, are you sure this is the right way?
:[wind whistling]
:[branches creaking]
:'''Scootaloo''': Sweetie Belle?
:[bushes rustle]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Scootaloo?
:'''Scootaloo''': Aah!
:[thud]
:'''Scootaloo''': Don't do that!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Girls?
:[snap!]
:[thud]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Maybe we should head back to the station.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I'm not sure we can. I think we're lost.
:'''Scootaloo''': Just like Twilight and the others said!
:'''Spur''': Well, where were you when I was feeding and caring for him?!
:[bushes rustle]
:'''Biscuit''': [screams] Wild swamp ponies!
:'''"Spring Green"''' and '''"Savage Honeydew"''': Hmph!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We're not wild swamp ponies. We're just grown-ups.
:'''Scootaloo''': And we are definitely not lost.
:'''Spur''': Okay. But that swamp is pretty confusing if you're not from around here. I'm Spur, and this is Biscuit.
:[rattling]
:'''Apple Bloom''': I'm Apple Bloom. Nice to meet you. But, uh, we're not confused. We're just... explorin' new ways to Appleloosa.
:'''Biscuit''': Hey, that's where we're going!
:'''Spur''': No, it isn't!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Uh, which is it?
:'''Spur''': Biscuit thinks he can just take Bloofy here to the fair.
:'''Biscuit''': Why not? It's just up the road. And Bloofy's ''my'' pet, too.
:'''Spur''': Since when?! Bloofy's never even seen a crowd! Which you'd know if you ever took care of him!
:'''Biscuit''': Did you ever think meeting all those ponies might be good for him?
:'''Bloofy''': [chittering]
:'''Apple Bloom''': He seems okay meetin' us.
:'''Biscuit''': See? They're grown-ups, and they get it. Bloofy should totally come to the fair with me, right?
:'''Spur''': Y'all don't really think that, do ya?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Um... Hold on. Us grown-ups need to confer. [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] What do you girls think?
:'''Scootaloo''': If they go to the fair, we can tag along!
:'''Apple Bloom''': And Spur probably should share Bloofy. I mean, that's somethin' a grown-up would say, right?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': As grown-up ponies, we think you should share Bloofy and let Biscuit take him to the fair.
:'''Biscuit''': That is some quality grown-up advice!
:'''Bloofy''': [chittering]
:'''Spur''': But Bloofy's never been around anything that exciting. What if something goes wrong?
:'''Apple Bloom''': We're headed to the fair, too. Since we're such great advice givers, feel free to ask us for more.

:[ponies chattering]
:[horseshoe clangs]
:[splash!]
:[ponies laughing]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [laughs] It's everything I thought it'd be!
:'''Bloofy''': [squealing]
:'''Passerby Pony''': Well, my goodness, what an interesting critter! You should enter him in the animal showcase. You'd be sure to win "Most Interesting Creature"!
:'''Biscuit''': Animals showcase? That's exactly what we should do!
:'''Spur''': That seems like a bad idea. What do you grown-ups think?
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [laugh]

:[thunk!]
:[bell rings]
:[ponies cheer]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [laugh]

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Whoo-hoo! Whoo-whoo!

:[splat]
:'''Spur''': What happened to being able to ask your advice?! You ran off the second we got here!
:'''Scootaloo''': [gulps]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Where's Biscuit and Bloofy?
:'''Spur''': That's why I came to find you.

:[fanfare]
:[ponies chattering]
:'''Spur''': It's one thing to bring Bloofy to the fair, but it's another to stick him in a showcase!
:'''Biscuit''': What's the big deal?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You are supposed to be sharing him.
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah, I'm with Biscuit. The showcase looks like fun.
:'''Spur''': Sorry if I think taking care of Bloofy is more important than having fun!
:'''Bloofy''': [shrieking]
:'''Biscuit''': Bloofy's just excited. He probably just wants to get out.
:'''Bloofy''': [chitters, sniffs]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Are you sure you're not just upset you have to share him? What if you took a little break?
:'''Spur''': You mean, like, leave?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': If sharing him is too hard, that might be the best thing. Take our word for it. We are grown-ups.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I don't know what Spur's so worried about. Bloofy and Biscuit are havin' fun.
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah. What could go wrong?
:'''Bloofy''': [chittering]
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Bloofy''': [squealing]
:[whooshing]
:'''Scootaloo''': Me and my big grown-up mouth.

:[ponies screaming]
:[whooshing]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Do you think this qualifies as gettin' into a dangerous situation with no grown pony to help us?
:[cow moos]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I think ''we're'' the grown ponies that need to be helping today!
:'''Scootaloo''': Bloofy! Treats, treats, treats! Who wants a treat?
:[whooshing continues]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Biscuit''': What do we do now?!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': ''Run!''

:[train whistle blows]
:'''Fluttershy''': I hope you're right about the girls coming here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, once we read Shadetail Evergreen's warning that the flower grants wishes, it wasn't a stretch to think they wished themselves to the fair. It's all they were talking about.
:'''Fluttershy''': Or maybe, since we told them they were too young to come, they wished to become grown-ups, then came here and caused some kind of trouble that led to a town-wide panic!
:[distant screaming]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah. Or that.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Twilight! Fluttershy! Thank goodness! I know you're not gonna believe it, but it's me, Apple Bloom!
:'''Scootaloo''': And I'm Scootaloo! We kinda got turned into grown-ups!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': And we thought we could take the train here, since we were old enough, but we ended up in the wrong place, just like you said we would!
:'''Apple Bloom''': And got lost!
:'''Scootaloo''': Just like you said we would!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Then we met these foals who led us to the fair, and we tried to give them some grown-up-style advice, but it turned their pet into a tornado that might destroy the whole town!

:[whooshing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Goodness! A Whirling Mungtooth! They are very rare and just the cutest little things when they're not excited.
:[crash!]
:'''Fluttershy''': This one's excited.
:'''Scootaloo''': How do we calm him down?
:'''Fluttershy''': When they're young, a Mungtooth forms a tight bond with its caretaker. They're the only ones who can get them to stop spinning.
:'''Biscuit''': Spur's the one who really took care of Bloofy. We have to find her!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You all go look for Spur. Fluttershy and I will do our best to keep everypony here safe.
:[teleportation zap]
:[ewe bleats]
:'''Spur''': ''That's'' Bloofy?!
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Biscuit''': I'm so sorry, Spur. You knew what was best for him all along.
:'''Apple Bloom''': And even though we seem like grown-ups, you were way more responsible than us.
:'''Spur''': What do you mean, "seem" like grown-ups?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Uh, we don't have time to explain. Right now we have to stop this, and you're the only one who can do it.
:'''Spur''': How?
:'''Fluttershy''': I'll show you. He mostly just needs to see you.
:'''Spur''': Hey there, Bloofy-boo. It's okay.
:[whooshing stops]
:'''Bloofy''': [squeals, chitters]
:'''Spur''': How did you know what to do?
:'''Fluttershy''': After years of experience with animals, I've picked up a few things.

:'''Spur''': Well, one thing's for sure. Bloofy definitely earned the "Most Interesting Creature" prize.
:'''Biscuit''': I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
:'''Apple Bloom''': We all are.
:'''Spur''': I guess grown-ups aren't always perfect.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They sure aren't, but young foals pretending to be grown-ups are even less so.
:'''Spur''': What do you mean?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There's only one petal left. But I think the three of you know what to wish for. And I'm pretty sure Star Swirl won't mind.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': We wish we were foals again.
:[magic sounds]
:'''Biscuit''': Hold on! You three are actually younger than us?!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': The flower turned us into grown-ups, so we figured we could do whatever we wanted. But I guess that's not exactly true.
:'''Apple Bloom''': We did everything real grown-ups told us not to and caused all kinds of trouble.
:'''Scootaloo''': And things could have been a lot worse. I guess we were pretty selfish.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm glad you learned something. That's what growing up is. Which is why you probably shouldn't skip any of it.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I know we didn't make the best impression, but we sure would like to visit you and Bloofy some day.
:'''Spur''': I guess that'd be okay, on one condition. You get a real grown-up to bring you.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Deal!
:'''All''': [laughing]

:'''Spike''': [sighs] I just wanted everything to be perfect. I mean, this was a big deal. But when Discord insists on being involved...

:'''Discord''': Regardless of what Spike might say, that little dragon begged me to help. And let me tell you, he can cause plenty of chaos all on his purple lonesome.

:'''Mrs. Cake''': I pride myself on baking under pressure, but I just... Oh, dear...

:'''Apple Bloom''': You'd think we would be used to stuff like this in Ponyville.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I still have nightmares.

:'''Spike''': It seemed simple when it started...

:'''Spike''': [gasps] It's beautiful!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup. Nope!
:'''Spike''': I'm not gonna eat it!
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Eat what? What is it! I want to see!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nope!
:'''Discord''': Why not?!
:'''Spike''': Because you have a big mouth.
:'''Discord''': Me?! I keep tons of secrets! Like Fluttershy's secret fear of clowns. Or that time I caught Twilight sleep-trotting through town. Oh! And did you know that Octavia went on a date with Bulk Biceps? [chuckles] Talk about an odd couple. I heard that— Oh. All right. Point taken. But we're pals, right? Comrades. Amigos. ''Come on!''
:[dreamy music]
:'''Discord''': [deep gasp] ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">big mac is going to propose to sugar belle?!?</span>'' [echoing]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Spike''': Of course Big Mac asked me to help with his proposal. I'm the most romantic dragon I know.

:'''Discord''': [sighs] It really is a curse having infinite powers. Everypony is always asking you to move a couch or help with a proposal.

:'''Spike''': Spill it! Every detail! Don't leave anything out!
:'''Discord''': Ugh. Do we have to hear all the details? Is that like a "friend" thing?
:'''Big McIntosh''': [sighs] Eeyup.
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': I don't talk much, so I want to ''show'' Sugar Belle how committed I am. First...
:[wood clattering]
:'''Spike''': [gasps] You're making a picnic table that matches the shelf you made Sugar Belle for her shop when you had a crush on her, and you're setting up a romantic meal overlooking Sweet Apple Acres?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Discord''': Uh, how did you figure that out?
:'''Spike''': If you were a hopeless romantic, you'd know that was the only logical choice.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Then...
:'''Spike''': You painted apples to leave around Ponyville with little riddles tied to the stem that will lead her up here to meet you?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Discord''': Seriously?!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Now...
:'''Spike''': Yuh—
:'''Discord''': I know! You need a giant rhino named Dolores who can knit a romantic sweater for two!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Uhhh... nope.
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]
:'''Spike''': Come on. He needs food for the picnic. That was a gimme.
:'''Discord''': I do not get this game.
:'''Spike''': Okay. You finish your table, I'll pick up whatever you need to eat, and Discord will put all the apples in place.
:'''Discord''': I will?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup!
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]

:[poof!]
:[goat bleats]
:[chicken clucks]
:'''Discord''': [reading] "From the Sugarcube Corner, look for your next clue. Red, delicious, sweet like you. Find it; you'll know what to do." [groans] He should stick to bucking apples.
:'''Spike''': Sugar Belle's gonna love it!
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': I'll get the food. How long will it take you to place all the apples?
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]
:'''Spike''': Are you sure you put them in the right spots?
:'''Discord''': Those terrible riddles on the apples were very clear on the location. I'm sure that they were placed properly.
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': I-I-I think. Maybe. Does it matter?
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Oh, okay, fine! I'll double-check.
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': She didn't see the apple! What are we gonna do?
:'''Discord''': Well, we could just ''give'' it to her.
:'''Spike''': That's not romantic! She needs to discover it!
:'''Discord''': Don't be such a drama dragon. I've precipitated liquid cocoa on Equestria and herded long-limbed Leporidae. I can certainly make a pony see an apple. [snaps]
:[poof!]
:'''Spike''': [sighs]

:[oven timer dings]
:'''Spike''': Hey, Mrs. Cake. I need to pick up a few things.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, I'm afraid you'll have to wait. I'm a bit busy at the moment. Oh. Is this sour cream or sweet cream?
:'''Spike''': Oh, it's kind of important. Maybe I could take some of these off your hooves?
:[smack!]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': No! Those are for... something important, too!
:'''Spike''': All of them? There's... one, two, three, four—
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Twenty-one! And yes, all of them!
:'''Spike''': Who needs twenty-one desserts?
:'''Mrs. Cake''': I can't tell you! It's a secret! Come by later.
:'''Spike''': Later won't work.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Why not?
:'''Spike''': I can't tell you. It's a secret.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': [muttering]
:'''Spike''': [gags] Ugh! Did somepony else bake these?
:'''Mrs. Cake''': No. Why?
:'''Spike''': No reason.

:[poof!]
:[pop]
:'''Discord''': Shhh.
:[poof!]
:'''Sugar Belle''': Thank you! These are perfect!
:[bits clinking]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': You know, if she's too busy to read the horribly written clues, maybe you should just tell her. [snaps]
:[poof!]
:[apple chittering]
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]
:[apples chittering]
:'''Discord''': [gruffly] Listen up! Each of you has a job to do! Take a look at your stems!
:[apples chittering]
:'''Discord''': Tell me about it. But regardless, go to your designated location, deliver your messages, and make me proud! Dismissed!
:[apples chittering]
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': [sighs] I just have to say, Big Mac is really lucky to have me as a friend.

:'''Mrs. Cake''': Okay... One down, twenty to go. Then I can help you.
:'''Spike''': Maybe ''I'' can help ''you''. Delivering parchments is my thing. A little dragon breath and fwoosh! We deliver each scroll into each dessert. Then you can help ''me''. Watch!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': [whimpers]
:'''Spike''': [inhales, blows fire] Ta-da!
:[flames roaring]
:[ponies screaming]

:'''Talking Apple''': Hurry, there's no need to sneak!
:'''Talking Apple 2''': The next apple is at the boutique!
:[ponies screaming]
:[apples chittering]
:[doors open]
:[pop]
:[apple chittering]
:[pony yelps]
:[doors close]
:'''Talking Apple 3''': At Twilight's castle, take a right! The next apple sits in plain sight!
:[ponies screaming]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': What in the blazes is going on?!
:'''Spike''': Discord.
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': [slurps] Oh! Are you finally finished? I've been done for a while.
:[ponies screaming]
:[splat]
:'''Discord''': You know, thinking back, I probably could have been clearer which pony to deliver the messages to.
:'''Spike''': You think?
:[apples chittering]
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': I sent them back to Sweet Apple Acres. Apples are ''terrible'' at taking directions. Couldn't even manage to stay in one location. Now, bananas... [chuckles] ...are much better at listening.
:'''Sugar Belle''': What's going on?
:'''Spike''': Apples running everywhere, and she didn't see the poem to get to the hilltop?!
:'''Discord''': Getting her to the hilltop is easy, and not seeing the poems is actually a blessing when you think about it. [snaps]
:[poof!]

:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]

:'''Mrs. Cake''': Why would you think sending flaming messages into my desserts would work?! You've ruined all of them!
:'''Spike''': To be honest, I tasted some, and burning them might have been an improvement.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': What?! I never!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Spike?
:'''Spike''': Aah! Uh, hey there, Big Mac. Heh. I bet you're wondering what—
:[poof!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Sugar Belle!
:'''Sugar Belle''': Big Mac?
:[poof!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Discord!
:'''Discord''': Mrs. Cake!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': What did I do?!
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Nothing. I thought we were just saying each other's names.
:'''Spike''': I guess this can't get any worse.
:'''Discord''': As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like that.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''' and '''Granny Smith''': [screaming]
:'''Granny Smith''': ''It's comin'! Save yourselves!''
:[booming]
:[birds chirping]
:'''Giant Apple''': '''''<big><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">sugar belle!!! sugar belle!!!</span></big>'''''

:'''Apple Bloom''': We have a bit of a reputation for gettin' carried away.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Especially when romance is involved. Heh.
:'''Scootaloo''': But that wasn't the case with this. We were just helping Sugar Belle with ''her'' plan.

:'''Sugar Belle''': And the last one should just say "Eeyup!"
:'''Mrs. Cake''': [muttering] Three tablespoons... So, you're saying you want to put each one of those inside a dessert?
:'''Sugar Belle''': Well, since Big Mac's plan to send me a Hearts and Hooves Day pie with a message inside didn't go so well, I thought it'd be fun to do it right.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Awww! That's so romantic!
:'''Sugar Belle''': He's a pony of few words. I love that about him. So, I thought I'd use as many words as possible to propose to him! All he has to say is—
:'''Apple Bloom''': [imitates Big McIntosh] Eeyup! [giggles, normally] I can't wait for you to be a part of the family!
:'''Sugar Belle''': You three played such a big part in Big Mac and I getting together. I'm glad you could help with this.
:'''Scootaloo''': [reading] "I-love-you-Big-Mac-would-you-like-to-spend-the-rest-of-our-lives-together-I-hope-you-say-eeyup!" And each word has to go into a dessert? That's... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Whoa!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Twenty-one! I know!
:'''Sugar Belle''': Actually, it's twenty-two. Mrs. Cake was kind enough to help me bake all the apple-flavored treats I made to get Big Mac to visit me in my old shop. ''That'' one has the invitation for ''him'' to come here.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, it's... it's no bother! I do love a challenge! Did I add the sugar to this one or to that one?
:'''Scootaloo''': I think I've seen her add sugar to that bowl six times so far.
:'''Sugar Belle''': Now you three go deliver that pie. I have to get some flowers to spruce the place up.
:[door opens]
:'''Sugar Belle''': [gasps]
:[door closes]
:'''Sugar Belle''': Uh-oh. Spike and Discord are outside. If they figure out what we're up to, they'll spill the beans! And I want this to be a surprise!
:[door opens]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': I don't think they suspect anything.
:'''Scootaloo''': Why would they suspect that we're holding an invitation pie and that Mrs. Cake is baking a twenty-one-dessert proposal?
:'''Apple Bloom''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I can't believe I'm gonna have a sister-in-law!</span>'' [echoing]
:'''Sweetie Belle''' and '''Scootaloo''': Shhhhhh!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': This is our shot to make up for all the trouble we caused when Big Mac first asked Sugar Belle out!
:'''Scootaloo''': We can't give away the surprise! You need to play it cool!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Right, right. Uh, how's this?
:'''Scootaloo''': Better?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Come on! Let's go find your brother!

:'''Big McIntosh''': Screwdriver... Nope.
:[barn door opens]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Big Mac! He ain't here. Let's go.
:'''Scootaloo''': Hold on... That looks just like the shelf Big Mac made for Sugar Belle. Weird.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Maybe we should wait here for him. He's bound to show up soon.
:'''Apple Bloom''': You know, When I'm lookin' for somethin', Granny says it's best to check the least likely place. Come on!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Screwdriver!

:[door creaks]
:'''Scootaloo''': Big Mac!
:[loud thud]
:[crash!]
:[door closes]

:[raccoons snoring]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Big Mac!
:[raccoons squeal]

:[door opens]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Big Mac!
:[pony screams]
:[door closes]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [groans]
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [sighs]

:'''Apple Bloom''': How is Sugar Belle supposed to propose to Big Mac if we can't even find him?!
:'''Scootaloo''': Mrs. Cake isn't finished yet. We still have time.
:'''Apple Bloom''': You know, when I'm lookin' for somepony, Granny says it's best to just stay in one place. Let's head back to the farm and wait. Big Mac is sure to show up soon!
:[beat]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, don't just stand there. Come on!
:[apples chittering]
:[poof!]
:'''Large Apple''': Love is in the air! [chitters]

:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:[beat]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeeeeeeeeyup.
:[squirrel chitters]

:'''Granny Smith''': [snoring]
:'''Scootaloo''': Granny!
:'''Granny Smith''': Aah! Who goes there?!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Granny, have you seen Big Mac?
:'''Granny Smith''': Oh. Hey there, li'l dumplin'. I just had the most peculiar dream.
:'''Scootaloo''': That's nice, Granny, but we really need to find Big Mac, so—
:'''Granny Smith''': It was about Grand Pear. Only it wasn't. We were in outer space on some kinda mission to explore a strange new world.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': If we get stuck listening to Granny, we'll never find Big Mac.
:'''Granny Smith''': And Mudbriar was there, bein' as logical as ever, but his ears was all pointy-like. And then Discord showed up and... well, you know, he was pretty much the same.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Once she gets goin', there's nothin' in Equestria that can stop her.
:[booming]
:'''Scootaloo''': You sure about that?
:[roaring]

:'''Big McIntosh''': Spike?
:'''Spike''': Aah! Uh, hey there, Big Mac. Heh. I bet you're wondering what—
:[poof!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Sugar Belle!
:'''Sugar Belle''': Big Mac?
:[poof!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Discord!
:'''Discord''': Mrs. Cake!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': What did I do?!
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Nothing. I thought we were just saying each other's names.
:'''Spike''': I guess this can't get any worse.
:'''Discord''': As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like that.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''' and '''Granny Smith''': [screaming]
:'''Granny Smith''': ''It's comin'! Save yourselves!''
:[booming]
:[birds chirping]
:'''Giant Apple''': '''''<big><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">sugar belle!!! sugar belle!!!</span></big>'''''
:'''Big McIntosh''': Discord!
:'''Discord''': Why does everypony immediately assume that this has something to do with me?
:'''Giant Apple''': '''''<big><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i love you! you love me! our love will grow like an apple tree! So let me ask – will you marry me?</span></big>'''''
:[splat]
:'''Discord''': Okay, but to be fair, the message did get to Sugar Belle.

:'''Discord''': This whole story is being twisted to make it seem like it was all my fault. Which it wasn't!

:'''Mrs. Cake''': Wait. So you two were orchestrating a proposal? That's what ''I'' was doing!
:'''Discord''': Who are you proposing to?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Discord!
:'''Discord''': Me?!
:'''Giant Apple''': '''''<big><span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i love you! i love you! i love you!</span></big>'''''
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[poof!]
:[apples thudding]
:'''Spike''': So the messages that were in the desserts...
:'''Mrs. Cake''': ...were Sugar Belle's proposal to Big Mac before Spike set them on fire!
:'''Discord''': Oh, so I'm not the only one who messes things up, am I, Mr. High-and-Mighty Dragon?
:'''Spike''': Hey! Those desserts were ruined way before I ruined them!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': They were not! Well, I... may have mixed up a... a few ingredients. It was such a rush.
:'''Discord''': You should both be very disappointed in yourselves.
:'''Scootaloo''': What about you and your apple monster?!
:'''Discord''': Yes, but you all expect that of me.
:'''Apple Bloom''': All we wanted to do was make up for messin' things up the last time. Sugar Belle, Big Mac, we're really—
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Where'd they go?
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Okay, this time, it really wasn't me!

:'''Mrs. Cake''': I shouldn't have taken all those desserts at once. It's just, how can you say no to such a sweet idea? Oh! Ha! "Sweet"! [laughs] I made a joke.

:'''Spike''': In retrospect, dragon flame and baked goods aren't the best combo.

:'''Apple Bloom''': We felt like it was all our fault.
:'''Scootaloo''': Except for the apple monster. That was Discord. And Mrs. Cake messing up those recipes. And Spike burning the messed-up recipes. And—
:'''Sweetie Belle''': The point is we all felt bad for ruining Big Mac and Sugar Belle's proposals.

:'''Granny Smith''': It was all green, and then Grand Pear looked at me all dramatical and says, "Where nopony has gone before!" And whoosh! Away we flew!

:'''Sugar Belle''': Today was... interesting.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Sugar Belle''': You okay?
:'''Big McIntosh''': I... I'm sorry, Sugar Belle. I wanted everything to go right today. I wanted our love to be as perfect as my parents' was when they planted these two trees together. Instead, it turned into a mess. Just like when I asked you out. Just like Hearts and Hooves Day. No matter how hard I try, I always seem to mess up when it comes to you.
:'''Sugar Belle''': I think you've got things backwards.
:'''Big McIntosh''': What do you mean?
:'''Sugar Belle''': From everything you told me about your parents, they had to deal with things a lot tougher than some burnt desserts and an apple monster.
:'''Big McIntosh''': I.... guess that's true.
:'''Sugar Belle''': This apple tree and pear tree are stronger together. They'll survive whatever comes because they don't have to do it alone. They belong together. Like your parents. And like us.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Sugar Belle''': Today was a disaster. But today was also the last day we're ever gonna have to do anything apart. From here on out, we'll be together. And we'll make sure everything always works out just right.
{|

:'''Big McIntosh''':
:Sugar Belle, will you—? Sorry.
|
:'''Sugar Belle''':
:Big Mac, will you—? No, I'm sorry.
|}
:'''Big McIntosh''': On three?
:'''Sugar Belle''': Sure. One...
:'''Big McIntosh''': Two...
:'''Big McIntosh''' and '''Sugar Belle''': Will you marry me? Eeyup! [kiss]
:'''Sugar Belle''': We'll have to thank our friends for messing up so bad that they made it all work out perfectly.
:[apple chitters]
:'''Discord''': Well, we've all made up, and we're here for a do-over. And this time, thanks to me, we've got it right. So, why don't you two... you know?
:'''Spike''': Uh, I think they did okay without us.

:'''Apple Bloom''': And that's how we were responsible for the perfect proposal! [laughs] Or, should I say, "pear-posal".
:'''Sweetie Belle''': If we hadn't messed up so bad...
:'''Scootaloo''': ...it wouldn't have worked out the way it did!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': It's just like baking. Sometimes, it's the mistakes that help you discover something truly special.
:'''Spike''': And when all the planning and grand gestures go wrong, it reminds you the most romantic things are usually the simplest.
:'''Discord''': Which is what I knew all along. You're welcome.
:[romantic music]
:'''Mayor Mare''': It is my sincere pleasure to say, for my second Apple family wedding, that I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride!
:'''All''': [cheering]
:'''Discord''': That's your cue!
:'''Apples''': [singing] Happy marriage, happy Apples! Happy marriage...
:'''Spike''': ''Discord!''
:'''Discord''': Oh, just let me have this one!
:'''Apples''': [singing] Happy marriage, happy Apples! Happy marriage, happy Apples!

:'''{{H:title|as Crackle Cosette|Queen Chrysalis}}''': Hey there, my unicorn friend. Have you heard?
:'''Unicorn Baker''': About Princess Twilight Sparkle's coronation? Who hasn't? I'm on my way there now. So much baking to do and—
:'''{{H:title|as Crackle Cosette|Queen Chrysalis}}''': No, no. [whispers] About the Earth ponies.
:'''Unicorn Baker''': I know their crops have been underperforming, but, uh...
:'''{{H:title|as Crackle Cosette|Queen Chrysalis}}''': That's not it. They're hoarding the food for themselves! I heard the Mayor of Appleloosa say that if unicorns and Pegasi want to eat, they can use their own hooves to dig.
:'''Unicorn Baker''': How awful!
:'''{{H:title|as Crackle Cosette|Queen Chrysalis}}''': We unicorns have to stick together, right? [sinister laughter]

:[transformation zap]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Ah, Chrysalis. Another successful field trip, I presume?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Spreading distrust among the unicorns and Earth ponies is almost too easy. We could take down Twilight and her friends a hundred times, but as long as they have the "love" of Equestria behind them, they'd crawl back to defeat us. Not anymore.
:'''Cozy Glow''': No friendship, no magic! It's so obvious when you think about it. I did my part freaking out the Pegasi.
:'''Lord Tirek''': And Grogar's long absence has given me time to prepare the next part of our plan. [blows]
:[grinding]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Grogar's Bell. This artifact can steal any creature's magic. It holds that magic until it is released by this spell. Which means all the power inside is ours for the taking! [kissing]
:'''Cozy Glow''': You're drooling on the Bell.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Let's try the spell before Grogar gets back. I'm sick of waiting for that old goat's master plan.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Take my hands.
:[beat]
:'''Lord Tirek''': So we can all be part of the spell. Unless you'd prefer I take all the magic myself?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Our pact stands. What we do, we do together. Once we defeat the protectors of Equestria, we can claim this land and rule our kingdoms ''alone'' once more.
:[magic humming]
:[reverberating gong]
:[magic humming]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Cozy Glow''': [laughing evilly]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Grogar''': I have returned. Twilight Sparkle's coronation is today, and we are going to ruin it with this artifact. But to succeed, you must work together.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Oh, way ahead of you, Grogar. [spits]
:[rumbling]
:[crash!]
:[magic zap]
:'''Grogar''': The Bell! You had it all this time?! Why didn't you tell me?!
:'''Cozy Glow''': We're villains. Duh.
:[magic zap]
:[reverberating gong]
:[magic humming]
:'''Grogar''': [pained groaning]
:[thud]
:'''Lord Tirek''': That was unexpected.
:'''Discord''': [snapping fingers]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Wait. Discord was Grogar? Like, the whole time? Should we follow him?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Without magic, he's no threat. Besides, we have plans.

:'''Princess Celestia''': Doesn't she look so adorably regal up there?
:'''Princess Luna''': Our little Twilight, all grown up. Should we tell her that we've cleared out our royal suites so she and Spike can move in?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, maybe wait until after the coronation. Twilight doesn't need anything else to worry about today.
:'''Spike''': So, you freakin' out yet?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': About what?
:'''Spike''': Oh, I don't know. It's not every day the princesses that have ruled Equestria for hundreds of moons retire and pass all their responsibilities on to your and your friends.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, that. Actually, I'm feeling pretty good. We've all faced so much and come out okay. I know we're up to the challenge of keeping Equestria safe and happy. There's nothing we can't handle together. Which reminds me...
:'''Spike''': Royal advisor? What's that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A new position I created for you. You've been at my side for every step of this journey. Knowing I had you to count on gave me the strength I needed to grow and succeed. I wouldn't be here without you.
:'''Spike''': Thanks, Twilight. You know I'll always be your right-hoof dragon.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I was hoping you'd say that. Because now that my crown's been fitted, we have some royal errands to run!

:[wind whistling]
:'''Rarity''': And you're sure this is where Pinkie told us to get the blackberries for her special coronation dessert?
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe they keep their produce in the back?
:'''Fruit Seller''': Nope. This is all we got. But I got a special on these taters.
:'''Rarity''': [gags]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, no, thank you. We'll keep looking.
:'''Rarity''': [gags, coughs] Ooh! Twilight, darling! You're just in time. Only one more pre-coronation stop. We're picking up the final touch for your ''apres-hors d'oevres'' gown...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is that before or after the royal marshmallow-eating-contest gown?
:'''Rarity''': What?! I haven't made one of those! You must tell me when they add these sorts of things!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs] It's okay, Rarity. I was just joking.
:'''Spike''': Joking? Day of her coronation? You've come a long way, Twilight.
:[door jiggling]
:'''Rarity''': Well, that's odd. They look open.
:[knock on door]
:'''Lemon Hearts''': What do you want?
:'''Rarity''': Oh. Well, this being a thread shop, I thought I might buy some?
:'''Lemon Hearts''': Put the bits in the mail slot.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What was that about?
:'''Rarity''': You know designers. Don't like being interrupted when they're on a creative roll. With thread this exquisite, can you blame them?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Weather for the coronation is sunny skies! It was weird, though. Not many Pegasi wanted to help me clear the clouds. They were kinda on edge.
:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Spike''': They're not the only ones.
:'''Rarity''': It's the first shift in royal power in over a millenium. Of course everypony is a little jumpy. Change does that.
:'''Fluttershy''': But I'm sure it's not because they're worried about you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How could they be? How many times have you saved their flanks by now?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're right. I'll just have to let everypony know that even with Celestia and Luna gone, we'll make sure things stay the same.

:'''Applejack''': Twilight! There you are! You mind tellin' your friend here that I don't need an official guard wherever I go? Especially if he ain't gonna help carry apples?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I appreciate you taking such good care of my friends, but we're fine now.
:'''Applejack''': It was the strangest thing. He kept callin' me "Earth pony", like I didn't have a name. And watchin' me like he thought I'd steal the silver!
:[loud thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Do ''not'' go in that kitchen!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You look like you were in a sugar war.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': For some reason, the bakers are super grouchy with each other. That unicorn chef started throwing dessert at Mrs. Cake! I tried to help, but I got caught in the crossfire! Tasty, tasty crossfire. [slurps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You sure this is just pre-coronation nerves?
:'''Discord''': [groans] My aching metatarsals! You know, you forget how convenient snap-travel is.
:'''Spike''': Wait. Did you just walk here on foot?
:'''Discord''': Yes, actually. And I have a confession to make. You see, I might have made the teeeeeniest boo-boo. All very well-intentioned and noble on my part, of course, but—
:'''Applejack''': Get to the point, Discord.
:'''Discord''': You remember that whole thing with King Sombra? That was slightly my fault. And by "slightly", I mean... I brought him back.
:'''Rarity''': You did?! But why?!
:'''Discord''': Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Which is why I also brought back three other villains who are now on the loose and not really big fans of yours. So... my bad.
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [gasp]

:'''Princess Luna''': Let me get this straight. You wanted to boost Twilight's confidence, so you brought back Chrysalis, Cozy Glow, and Tirek to attack her?!
:'''Discord''': Don't forget Sombra.
:'''Princess Celestia''': And while you united these three villains, ''you'' pretended to be Grogar?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Discord, how could you do this to Twilight?! And us?!
:'''Discord''': Look what a great job you did defeating Sombra. All the confidence you gained. Remember the cheering? The hoof-bumps?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Except it was all a lie.
:'''Discord''': A well-intentioned lie.
:'''Applejack''': For all the time you've spent with us, you really haven't picked up too much in the way of friendship lessons, huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You've been setting up challenges for us the whole time, haven't you? None of our successes were actually real.
:'''Discord''': Of course they were! You just had an extremely good-looking safety net.
:'''Spike''': And how was that supposed to help again?
:'''Discord''': I intended to prepare Twilight for anything by orchestrating an epic attack at her coronation.
:'''Rarity''': You beastly beast! Don't you know how much this day means to Twilight?! And me?! I made her dress! Why wait until now for such a horrible plan?!
:'''Discord''': You don't take a final exam on your first day of class. Just think – after defeating ''three'' baddies, Twilight would have to believe that she's the leader we all know she is!
:'''Princess Celestia''': You have made a grave misjudgment, Discord. Do you have anything else you'd like to tell us?!
:'''Discord''': Would you like the good news or the bad news?
:'''Princess Luna''': ''That'' wasn't the bad news?!
:'''Discord''': All my chaos magic is... gone. Trapped in Grogar's Bell.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] So what's the good news?
:'''Discord''': Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy Glow now have all of the real Grogar's magic.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">in what world is that good news?!</span>''
:'''Discord''': Compared to me losing my powers, anything else ''is'' good news!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight, Luna, we need to make a plan. Maybe it's not too late to stop this disaster from happening!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I... I need some time to think first.
:'''Discord''': Well, there isn't any time! Look what I overheard them saying! [snaps]
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': Ugh! Just listen to my voice and use your imagination!

:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [in Discord's voice] Let the fool go. Without magic, he's no threat. Besides, we have plans.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [in Discord's voice] The "Lame Six" are so busy being perfect, they haven't even noticed what we've been up to. Have I mentioned how great revenge is?
:'''Lord Tirek''': [in Discord's voice] I hope you got a name picked out for your future kingdom. Because it's time to destroy Equestria!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''', '''Cozy Glow''', and '''Lord Tirek''': [laughing evilly in Discord's voice]

:'''Discord''': They're probably on their way to attack Canterlot right now!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Then we'll stop 'em!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How?! Stopping Sombra by himself was hard enough! And that was with lord-of-chaos training wheels!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight, it doesn't matter if Discord set up your successes or not. We believe in you and always have.
:'''Princess Luna''': Lean on your strengths to counter your weaknesses.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My strengths? Right! Spike! Send a letter to Star Swirl! Tell him we need the Pillars to guard the border of Canterlot!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [voiceover] If the villains are coming for a fight, we'll have one waiting for them! With Chrysalis on the loose, she'll go after Starlight! Warn Cadance and Shining Armor! They're our final line of defense if we fail!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The ultimate battle for the fate of Equestria is coming!

:'''Cozy Glow''': We're not going anywhere until you two stop arguing! Chrysalis, say something nice about Tirek.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [groans] He's... red.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Tirek?
:'''Lord Tirek''': She's... not as annoying as I expected.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Good! Now we were talking about Grogar's Bell.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': We should take the magic inside it. You know how powerful Discord was. That much chaos magic in our veins...
:'''Lord Tirek''': But taking it all would be madness! It's impossible for any other creature to control!
:'''Cozy Glow''': I guess if you need a guinea pig to find out if anypony can use chaos magic, I'll volunteer.
:[magic zap]
:[reverberating gong]
:[magic humming]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [bellowing evil laughter] Fools! Now I have more power than all of you! Kneel before my might!
:[magic zap]
:[rubber chickens squeak]
:[magic zaps]
:[pineapples snarling]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Aah! Take it back! Take it back!
:[magic zap]
:[reverberating gong]
:[magic humming]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [panting]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Still think chaos magic is a good idea?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Leave it in the Bell. We've got a kingdom to conquer.
:'''Cozy Glow''': So, where should we strike first?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [laughs] Everywhere.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We've faced enemies of Equestria before. And we've always succeeded, no matter the odds. That wouldn't be possible without all of you.
:'''Discord''': You're welcome!
:'''Spike''': Dude, read the room.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So I ask for your help again today in what is our biggest battle yet. All of Equestria is at stake, and I can't do this alone. But I'm not afraid. Because with friendship as our armor and teamwork as our power, nopony can ever bring us down!
:[doors open]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, come on!
:[thud]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Where'd you get that? A daily affirmations calendar? Yeesh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Cozy Glow?! You're—!
:'''Cozy Glow''': About to wipe the floor with you!
:[zap!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aah! [groans]
:'''All except Twilight Sparkle''': [gasp]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Wow! It's true! Alicorns really ''do'' have more fun!
:[zap!]

:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': Spread out and stay ready, friends! Canterlot depends on us!
:[booming]
:[loud thud]
:[zap!]
:'''Lord Tirek''': [laughs, grunts]
:'''Rockhoof''': [groans]
:[teleportation zap]
:[zaps]
:'''Lord Tirek''': [cackling]
:[thud]
:[smack!]
:[thud]
:[magic humming]
:'''Pillars''': [groans]
:'''Lord Tirek''': [smacks lips] Magic seasoned with age. Delicious.
:'''Rockhoof''': No!
:[shatter!]
:[magic humming]
:'''Rockhoof''': [groans]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Oh, run along. The big stallions are playing.
:'''Rockhoof''': [groans] Somnambula...! Warn... the princesses...!
:[loud thud]
:[magic humming]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Ahhhh. The perfect dessert to a legendary meal.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Stay with your buddy! No running! Just follow Counselor Trixie!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Starlight, star bright. Where's the pony I want to fight?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I have to go. You got this?
:'''Trixie''': Nopony does a great and powerful escape like Trixie.
:[teleportation zap]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Ah. Just the headmare I want to see.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You didn't make an appointment! [yells]
:[teleportation zap]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Queen Chrysalis''': [groan]
:[wind howling]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': What is this place?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Somewhere you can't hurt anypony!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Wrong. I can hurt ''you!''
:[multiple magic/teleportation zaps]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Argh!
:[multiple magic/teleportation zaps]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [growls] Stay still so I can blast you!
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, yeah, real motivating!
:[zap!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Aah!
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [snarls]
:[zap!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Ugh! You'll pay for that!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Put it on my tab!
:[teleportation zap]
:[zap!]
:[rumbling]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': No!
:[crash!]
:[teleportation zap]
:[boom!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Aah! Ugh! [groaning]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Now I'll have all eternity to take my revenge on you!

:[zaps]
:'''Royal Guards''': [yelling]
:[zap!]
:'''Royal Guards''': [groaning]
:[splash]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [laughing evilly]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Stand down, Cozy Glow!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Gee, I guess I could. But... I'm having too much fun!
:[zap!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Princess Celestia''', and '''Princess Luna''': Aah!
:[boom!]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Ready, sister?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait! What are you...?
:[zap!]
:[reverberating gong]
:[magic humming]
:'''Princess Celestia''' and '''Princess Luna''': [scream, pained groans]
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': NO!
:'''Cozy Glow''': That's the problem with you magic-types. You're so reliant on all your special power, you forget to use your brains!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Keep telling yourself that! Now!
:[whoosh!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Whoaaaa!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Surprise attack!
:[boom!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [coughs]
:'''Fluttershy''': Fly, my pretties!
:[geese squawking]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Aah!
:'''Spike''': [breathes fire]
:[boom!]
:[geese squawking]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [grunts]
:'''Spike''': [breathes fire]
:[geese squawking]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Aah! Aah!
:[thud]
:[clatter]
:[boom!]
:[wind blowing]
:[thud]
:[magic hums]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': You think your pathetic shield can stop us? [laughs] The Pillars have been defeated. Your school is abandoned. Face it, Twilight. You've lost!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can attack us and we may fall. But Equestria will still stand, united in friendship. And we won't stop until we defeat you, no matter how many ponies you take down!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''', '''Lord Tirek''', and '''Cozy Glow''': [laugh]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Didn't you all notice something was wrong in Equestria? We've been busy.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': A whisper here, a rumor there...
:'''Lord Tirek''': Destroy some crops, cause some damage...
:'''Cozy Glow''': Turn pony against pony...
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Until your whole kingdom is on edge, waiting for just one tiny thing to push them over the brink!
:'''Lord Tirek''': There's no backup friends or rainbow magic to save you now!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Golly, I think it's time for some redecorating!
:[magic humming]
:[explosion]
:[crumbling]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': You know what's stronger than friendship, Twilight? Fear!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aah!
:[shatter!]
:'''Lord Tirek''': 'Cause when you have to protect yourself, you don't have time for anypony else.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Too bad you never taught ''that'' in school.
:[magic humming]
:[crunch!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh?
:'''Rarity''': [groans]
:[zap!]
:[boom!]
:[rumbling]
:'''Rarity''': Go, Twilight! Get help!
:'''Applejack''': We'll hold 'em 'til you get back!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! I can't leave you here!
:'''Fluttershy''': It's our only chance!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You'll come up with something to save the day!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You always do!
:'''Spike''': We believe in you!

:[Previously on My Little Pony]

:'''Spike''': It's not every day the princesses pass all their responsibilities on to you and your friends.

:'''Princess Luna''': You wanted to boost Twilight's confidence, so you brought back Chrysalis, Cozy Glow, and Tirek to attack her?!

:'''Cozy Glow''': Discord was Grogar?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You've been setting up challenges for us the whole time, haven't you?

:'''Discord''': My bad.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The ultimate battle for the fate of Equestria is coming!

:[explosion]

:'''Applejack''': We'll hold 'em 'til you get back!
:'''Discord''': ''Fly, you foal!''
:[teleportation zap]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Cozy Glow''': And now for your complete destruction! Won't that be fun?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Patience, Cozy. Destruction is so... permanent. We need to show the rest of Equestria that we've broken their heroes first. Besides, we should have fun with our guests.
:'''Lord Tirek''': No! We should hunt down Twilight Sparkle. As long as she's out there, she's dangerous.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Is that big, strong minotaur that scared of one little pony? Relax. It's not like her friends are going anywhere.
:[fizzle]
:[cage creaks]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': The fools brought the remains of my throne to Canterlot to protect themselves. Hah! Those shards block their magic. [to Cozy Glow] Careful. Too close and the shards cancel even our powers. But on this side of the cavern, we're the most powerful beings in Equestria, thanks to Grogar's Bell. Isn't that right, "Grogar"?
:[chains clanking]
:'''Lord Tirek''': What are you doing?! You saw what happened when you tried to take Discord's chaos magic.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Yeah, but there's Alicorn princess magic in there now, too! I could be so much more powerful if I just could have—
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': What do you mean ''you'' could be?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Um, hello? I'm the best one out of all of us! Nobody sees... [continues under]
:'''Lord Tirek''': What are you talking about?!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': The best at what?!
:'''Fluttershy''': This is really bad.
:'''Applejack''': We gotta find Twilight. She's probably already figured out some way to defeat those monsters.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Any idea how we get out of here to do that?
:[squish]
:'''Spike''': Too sticky. There's no way anypony could get through this.
:'''Discord''': I'm so sorry. It made so much sense in my head. Twilight defeats her worst enemies and is filled with confidence. I truly did have the best intentions. I swear I'll make it up to you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's gonna need to be a pretty epic make-up.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Stay away from the Bell, you pest!
:[zap!]
:'''Lord Tirek''': None of us can use the Alicorns' magic until we figure out how to handle that fool's ridiculous chaos magic!
:'''Discord''': I could always tell you how. It would give you power over all reality. But you'd have to ask nicely and spare my friends.
:'''Spike''': No, Discord! This isn't the way to help!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Discord, could you pweeeease—?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Threats are more my speed. Speak!
:'''Lord Tirek''': He's lying. He won't tell us.
:'''Discord''': I certainly won't tell ''you'' after the way you lied to ''me'' last time we teamed up, you muscle-bound cretin.
:'''Lord Tirek''': This "cretin" could destroy you before you blink, so choose your words carefully.
:'''Discord''': You're right. "Cretin" is too polite. How about "pathetic centaur who uses magic to compensate for the fact that deep down he's afraid he'll never be enough to please dear old dad, King Vorak"?
:[zap!]
:[boing! boing! boing!]
:[crash!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [laughs] You missed!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Did he, though?!
:[whirring]
:[shing!]
:[crash!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Get her!
:[multiple magic/teleportation zaps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [blows raspberry]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Applejack''': Get Twilight!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No way! She's always needed you guys!
:[whoosh!]
:[zap!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Ugh!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Find Twilight! We may not have our magic, but we aren't completely helpless! We'll hold them off as long as we can!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That... was a pretty epic make-up.
:'''Discord''': Just save Equestria. And keep Fluttershy safe!
:[multiple magic/teleportation zaps]

:[crash!]
:'''Unicorn 1''': Why are you out in the open?! Hide!
:'''Rarity''': Where is everypony?
:'''Unicorn 1''': The unicorns have been gathering in Celestia's School of Magic ever since the attack. That's where I was headed when I saw you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What about the Earth ponies and Pegasi?
:'''Unicorn 1''': It's everypony for themselves.
:'''Applejack''': That ain't right.
:'''Unicorn 1''': Well, you can all stand out here and debate. I'm goin' where I'm safe.
:'''Spike''': Chrysalis was telling the truth. They really have turned ponies against each other.
:'''Applejack''': Everypony's scared, that's all. We just need to get to Ponyville and find Twilight pronto. She'll know how to set things right.

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Mayor Mare''': Please, stay calm! I know it seems bad, but there's no need to panic!
:'''"Winter Lotus"''': ''Give us one good reason not to!''
:[ponies yelling]
:'''Mayor Mare''': [sighs] Because Ponyville's own heroes of Equestria are here to save us!
:'''Applejack''': Where'd all these ponies come from?
:'''Granny Smith''': Earth ponies been pourin' in lookin' for somewhere safe.
:'''"Winter Lotus"''': We don't have unicorn magic to protect us or a city in the sky to hide in like those cowardly Pegasi!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cowardly?!
:[clouds rumbling]
:'''"Winter Lotus"''': They're blocking Cloudsdale! Said they didn't want any "grounded" ponies up in their business!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Listen up, buddy—!
:'''Fluttershy''': Don't! That's exactly what Chrysalis and the others want. More fighting. We know you're scared. We're here to help.
:'''S08E14 Unnamed Earth Mare #4''': You better fix this!
:[ponies yelling]
:'''Applejack''': Twilight's probably as worried as everypony else and tryin' to find somewhere safe. That's why I was sure she'd be waitin' for us in Ponyville. Where else could she be?
:'''Spike''': [gasps] I know where Twilight is!

:[doors open]
:'''Princess Cadance''': Oh, thank Celestia you're all alright. She's upstairs. It's... not good.
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're here?! I was so worried! Where are the princesses?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': They put up a crazy fight so we could escape and find you! Mission accomplished! Now let's save Equestria! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They made a terrible mistake. You all did. From the second I got away, I've been searching every book, scroll, and spell for a way to rescue you and stop Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy, but I haven't found anything. I failed.
:'''Spike''': You'll come up with something. We can't save Equestria without you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You all escaped without my help. You didn't need me then. So why would anypony need me now?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We know things look bad, but we've been in tough spots before, and we always—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Look around! Nothing we've ever done has mattered! Sombra? Returned and destroyed the Tree of Harmony! Chrysalis, Tirek, Cozy Glow? Returned and more powerful than ever! The School of Friendship? Shut down! Everypony in Equestria is so blinded by fear, they can't remember what friendship is! Nothing we do makes any difference!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But ''we're'' still free and together.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And it's not like things can get any worse.
:[windigos neighing]
:[wind howling]
:'''Spike''': Haven't we learned never to say that by now?

:[windigos neighing]
:'''Earth Pony 2''': The windigos!
:'''"Winter Lotus"''': [scoffs] That's just a Hearth's Warming Eve story.
:'''Earth Pony 2''': Creatures made of wind that spread cold and misery across the land to punish ponies?! Seems pretty real to me! Let the Pegasi deal with this! There's nothing we can do except hide!
:[ponies panicking]

:'''"Cotton Sky"''': That's enchanted wind! We can't control it! And we can't rely on those snooty unicorns for any help! Build up the cloudbank! We'll try to block it!
:'''Hyper Sonic''': What about everypony down below?
:'''"Cotton Sky"''': They're on their own. We all are.

:[windigos neighing]
:'''Unicorn 1''': Fortify the shields around the School of Magic! We need to protect ourselves! It's all we can do.
:[ponies chattering]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': We have to do something!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've already done enough.
:'''Applejack''': You want the truth, Twilight? Bad things happen. No matter what you do, there's never gonna be a time when everything's perfect. But that don't mean you quit tryin'!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What if I make things worse?! Ever since Celestia told me I was taking over, I've been gaining confidence. Then I find out it's all a lie. Equestria's been falling apart around us, and I didn't even notice! What kind of princess does that make me? I'm scared.
:'''Fluttershy''': I probably know more about being scared than anypony. But thanks to all of you, I've learned I'm always less scared when I'm with my friends.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': If we're facing impossible odds, we're facing them together!
:'''Rarity''': It's what we always do, darling.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But we're on our own, and we have no idea what to do!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's true pretty much every time something terrible is about to happen.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We don't have the Elements of Harmony anymore. How can you all be so calm about this?
:'''Spike''': Because, even if you don't believe you can do this, we do. We believe in you. In us.
:'''Applejack''': The truth is, all our lives wouldn't be the same if we hadn't met. We're better off because of our friendship with you. So when you say you haven't made a difference, that's just not true. You've made a big difference to us.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you. Sometimes even the Princess of Friendship needs a reminder that there's more to the Magic of Friendship than rainbow lasers.
:'''Spike''': Although that part ''is'' pretty cool.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We still need a plan.
:[door opens]
:'''Princess Cadance''': ''That'' sounds like the pony I used to foal-sit for. Count us in.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. You need to stay here and protect Flurry Heart. If we don't... If things don't work out, she's Equestria's last hope. Okay. Three of our worst villains have taken over, powered up by ancient magic. Everypony in Equestria is so scared and divided that the windigos are circling. And it's up to us to fix it all.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What are we gonna do, Twilight?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The same thing we do every time, Pinkie. Try to save the world!

:'''Lord Tirek''': Every prisoner is safely in their cells. Now we can hunt down the rest of the— Windigos?
:'''Cozy Glow''': I'm not hunting anypony d-d-d-down in ''this'' weather! Can't we magically get rid of them and w-w-w-warm things up?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': I don't think we should. This could work out quite well for me.
:'''Lord Tirek''': You mean ''us''.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': The harsh weather is the final blow to break the ponies' spirits. Once Equestria is a frozen wasteland, we'll use our magic to destroy those windy beasts. Ponies will be so grateful, they'll do whatever I want!
:'''Lord Tirek''': The windigos are ancient magic. It would be unwise to leave them unchecked. Best we deal with them now.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [snarls]
:'''Cozy Glow''': We probably should deal with Twilight and her friends before anything else.
:'''Lord Tirek''': I thought it was too cold for you to hunt anypony down.
:'''Cozy Glow''': We don't need to. They're right there!

:'''Spike''': You think they know we're here?
:[magic whooshing]
:'''Applejack''': I'd say they have an idea.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That bell has Discord, Celestia, and Luna's magic inside. If they use it against us—
:'''Fluttershy''': Discord's magic is so chaotic, he's the only one who can use it.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': You just can't accept that you were beaten before you even realized there was a fight, can you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can't beat us if we never give up! As long as I have my friends by my side, I'll put my faith in friendship—
:'''Cozy Glow''': Ugh, can we get on with this please?
:[zap!]
:[boom!]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We need to get that bell and get Discord and the princesses their magic back. Rainbow Dash, Pinkie, you're with me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sweet! I'll grab that bell in ten second—!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. We're the distraction. ''They're'' gonna get the bell.
:[boom!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Come out, come out, wherever you are!
:'''Cozy Glow''': There!
:'''Pinkie Pie''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [yell]
:[magic zaps]
:[whoosh!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Whoa!
:[teleportation zap]
:[neck cracking]
:[whoosh!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [yells]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Aah!
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Step right up, evil fillies and gentlevillains! Try your luck!
:[zap!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [growls]
:[zap!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': grunting]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Missed me!
:[zap!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Close, but no cherrychimichanga!
:[zap!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] Thanks for playing!
:[zap!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Do they have to be so annoying?!
:[zap!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Not annoying! Distracting!
:[boom!]
:[zap!]
:'''Spike''': Aah!
:[magic surging]
:[shatter!]
:'''Spike''': [breathes fire]
:[zap!]
:[boom!]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:[rope snaps]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Now, now, professor. We all know you're not the fast one.
:[zap!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Enough! Or the dragon's wings get plucked!
:'''Spike''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Please! Don't hurt him!
:'''Spike''': Don't worry about me! Just save—! [groans]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Turns out that the Magic of Friendship is your biggest weakness. A fitting end to your pathetic story.
:[magic whirring]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No matter what, we face it together!
:[windigos howl]
:[zap!]
:[boom!]
:[magic humming]
:'''Spike''': What happened? Can I open my eyes?
:'''Applejack''': Ya sure can! Way to go, Twilight!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's not me!
:[marching sounds]
:[whooshing]
:[transformation zaps]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Don't let them escape!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Which ones?!
:[zap!]
:[stomps]
:[whooshing]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Whoa!
:[magic zaps]
:'''Thorax''': The changelings won't fool them forever. And I don't know how long the unicorns' shield will hold.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't understand. How are you all here?
:'''Gallus''': That's kinda our fault.
:'''Smolder''': You know those long lectures about friendship you gave at school?

:[windigos howling]
:[ponies panicking]
:'''Sandbar''': We all know the story of Hearth's Warming Eve! We can defeat the windigos together!
:'''Berryshine''': You really think if we all sing a couple songs, everything will be fine?
:'''Sandbar''': It's not just singing that saved the founders of Equestria! It's what it represented!

:'''Rasberry'''{{sic}}''' Dazzle''': Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi becoming friends! We learned at Twilight's school that friendship is the most powerful magic there is!

:'''Hyper Sonic''': Focusing on our differences keeps us divided! Villains and creatures like the windigos use that division against us!

:'''Yona''': Yaks strong. Ponies strong. But yaks and ponies stronger together! Yaks must be ''loyal'' to pony friends!

:'''Smolder''': I know helping other creatures by being ''kind'' and ''generous'' sounds lame. But I've seen how powerful it can be!

:'''Gallus''': Playing together! Singing together! Even ''laughing'' together! That's what real heroes look like!

:'''Silverstream''': Were we really happy by ourselves at the bottom of the ocean? Be ''honest''! It's the ponies that showed us a better way!

:'''Ocellus''': They've taught us how powerful love and the ''Magic'' of Friendship truly is! We can't let them stand alone! We're their friends! They need us!

:'''Applejack''': How 'bout that? It's just like you said the day we opened that school.
:'''Spike''': The more creatures who know about friendship, the safer we'll be.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We told you you had it all figured out!
:[thud!]
:[thud!]
:[cracking]
:[magic zaps]
:[zap!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ENOUGH! Because of you, I almost lost my way! But everycreature here has reminded me of the true power of friendship! There will always be darkness in the world, but there will also always be those who find the light! The Pillars knew this! That's why they created the Elements of Harmony! The Elements showed me and my friends how strong our friendship could be! Together we worked to bring harmony to Equestria! But there will always be more to do! Which is why we teach others about the Magic of Friendship! Others who will continue our mission after we are gone! Now I truly understand! The Elements were just symbols! The real magic has always been right here! And the more who understand how powerful friendship is, the stronger we will all be! Together!
:[magic surging]
:[boom!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': This is bad, isn't it?
:[BOOM!]
:[magic humming]
:[clang!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [groans]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': You think friendship will save you?! We will always return! Nothing will ever stop—!
:[splat!]
:[rain falling]
:'''Spike''': [slurps] Chocolate rain?
:[teleportation zaps]
:'''Discord''': Don't look at me!
:[electrical discharge]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie! You took Discord's magic from the bell?! How do you feel?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmmm... Tingly. Itchy. Also like...
:[slam!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">i could transform the cosmos so everything is made of icing!</span>''
:'''Discord''': Perhaps maybe I should...
:[reverberating gong]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [dizzily] Waiter! There's some chaos in my soup!
:[reverberating gong]
:'''Discord''': [snaps]
:[pineapple snarls]
:[reverberating gong]
:'''Princess Celestia''': There isn't a punishment worthy of all you've done!
:'''Discord''': [whispering] You know what I would do if I were... [indistinct]
:'''Princess Luna''': Oh. That ''does'' seem fitting.
:'''Discord''': May I help? Please?
:[zap!]
:[boom!]
:[cracking]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [snarls]
:[thud!]
:'''Discord''': Together forever. I can't think of anything that they would want less!
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Princess Celestia''': When I sent you to Ponyville, I had high hopes. When you became Princess of Friendship, I knew I made the right choice. But nothing could prepare me for how proud I am right now. Equestria is definitely in the right hooves. You are ready.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You know what? I think I am.
:'''Applejack''': Thank goodness. First question, your Highness. What do we do with all these creatures?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': We're gonna need a lot more chairs for the coronation!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, as ruler of Equestria, I'd like to postpone the coronation for a while. At least until the castle's rebuilt. Besides, there's something we need to do first.

:'''Rarity''': Post-apocalyptic donuts. Interesting choice.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know. But there's gonna be plenty of time for all the challenges and struggles and adventures to come. For now, I just want to spend a quiet moment with the six best friends I've ever had.
:'''Applejack''': Well, mostly quiet.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [eating noisily] Mmmm!
:'''Fluttershy''': It's like the end of an era.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Or the beginning of an even more awesome era!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All I know is whatever comes next is going to be perfect.
:'''Spike''': How do you know that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': With you guys by my side, how could it not?
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [laugh]

:[ponies and creatures chattering]
:[camera clicks]
:[door opens]
:'''Future Spike''': I got here as soon as I could, but friendship ambassador is a full time job these days. Making peace between Abyssinians and the Diamond Dogs has not been easy.
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': That's why I picked you for the job. But I'm glad you could come.
:'''Future Spike''': So what's the emergency?
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': Ever since I took over Celestia's School, my focus has been on teaching magic. But now it seems my top student has missed the most important lesson of all.
:'''Future Spike''': What do you mean?
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': Let's just say it'll be good to have my royal advisor and friendship ambassador by my side.
:'''Future Gallus''': Your Majesty, she's here.
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': Send her in, Gallus.
:[door opens]
:'''Luster Dawn''': Your Majesty.
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': Luster, I may be ruler of Equestria, but I'm still just your teacher.
:'''Luster Dawn''': And you've been wonderful. I've enjoyed every moment at the School of Magic. But I'm just not sure it's the right place for me.
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': I see.
:'''Luster Dawn''': And it's not the work. I could spend weeks in the library doing research. It's just that there's a lot of focus on making friends.
:'''Future Spike''': If that's your problem, you've come to the right place.
:'''Luster Dawn''': But that's just it. I don't want to make friends.
:'''Future Spike''': What?! [clears throat]
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': So you'd rather leave the School of Magic than make friends?
:'''Luster Dawn''': I was hoping to set up an independent course of study. I want to accomplish as much as you have someday.
:'''Future Spike''': It'll be hard to do that without friends.
:'''Luster Dawn''': I'm not so sure. Friendship looks like more of a distraction than anything else and ultimately a waste of time.
:'''Future Spike''': ''What?!''
:'''Luster Dawn''': I know you and your friends accomplished a lot together, but that was so long ago, and as far as I can see, you rule by yourself now.
:'''Future Spike''': Uh, hello? Royal advisor right here.
:'''Luster Dawn''': And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. In fact, I think it's better. Plus, if friendships ultimately fade, why even make them in the first place?
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': You know what, Luster Dawn? You're right.
:'''Future Spike''': ''WHAT?!''

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Future Spike''': Friendship is more trouble than it's worth?! [to Twilight] This is your top student?
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': Friendships take work, and there's no guarantee they'll last. They can be complicated. They can be messy. And they never go the way you plan. Friendship is a hard thing to navigate. I remember the first time I realized it might not last forever.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting, yelping]
:'''Spike''': Twilight? Uh, I'm pretty sure that's everything.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm just doing a final check, Spike.
:'''Spike''': But we did a final check. Of every room. Twice.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah-ha! See? An issue of ''Power Ponies''. Now, aren't you glad we triple-checked?
:'''Spike''': Thanks, but I already read this one. I don't need to take it to Canterlot.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No-no-no! You love ''Power Ponies''. We're taking it.
:'''Spike''': Really, Twilight, we don't have to bring the comic. I'm not even sure how much longer I'll collect them. A lot is changing, and I am getting older.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just because things change doesn't mean you leave everything you love behind! [sighs]
:'''Spike''': You're not still worried about ruling Equestria, are you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. I know it took some time, but I've never been more ready for anything in my life. Just because I'm ready to sit on the throne in Canterlot, doesn't mean I'm ready to leave Ponyville. When we were all fighting to save Equestria from Tirek, Chrysalis, and Cozy Glow, I was too busy to think about it. But now it's all happening at once.
:'''Spike''': What is?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The coronation. Moving. Leaving our friends.
:'''Spike''': I thought we'd all be ruling Equestria together.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course we will, but it won't be the same. They all have lives here. We're moving away and they're not, and I can't help but feel like we're leaving them behind. What if we all just drift apart?
:'''Spike''': I guess I hadn't thought about it like that. Maybe you should talk to them. I bet they're feeling the same way.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're right, Spike. Thanks. Sometimes talking to a good friend is all it takes.

:[crates closing]
:[stamping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, you're not worried about how things might change with me living in Canterlot?
:'''Applejack''': Of course not. Change is natural, like the seasons. That's just life on the farm.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I guess so.
:'''Applejack''': Anyhoo, I really need to get all these boxes packed and sorted. There's a lot more work now that the folks beyond Equestria are comin' to the coronation, too.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Worried? Pfft! No way! Unless you're talking about the coronation, because then yes. Obviously the cakes are handled, but there's the whole rest of the party to stay on top of. [whispering] And honestly, I'm not convinced Gummy really took care of the fireworks.
:[sparkler sizzling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But what about after the coronation? Don't you think things are gonna be different?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, since I'll be in charge of all the Canterlot galas from now on, I'll have to go there a lot more. So I guess that's different, but I don't think I mind.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. Of course not.

:[birds chirping]
:[doves cooing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Wonderful work, everyone! We couldn't be more ready. Josephine, if you and the rest of the doves leave now, we should all arrive in Canterlot at the same time.
:[doves cooing]
:'''Fluttershy''': Eloise and Hubert, you should go, too. I know it's a long way, but don't worry. I'll bring plenty of snacks to restore your energy before we perform.
:[swans honking]
:'''Fluttershy''': Everyone else gets to ride since the trip's too much for your little wings. We need everyone in tip-top shape for the coronation. I'm glad we got the chance for one last rehearsal. Everyone's so excited. But I can't imagine anypony's more excited than you. Moving to Canterlot. Being crowned. I can't think of a single bad thing about any of it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous laugh] Yeah. Me, neither.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': In three, two, one, and...
:[whooshing]
:[smack!]
:[zoom!]
:[soft thud]
:'''Spitfire''': Look, Rainbow Dash. I know this is important to you, and we all want the routine to be special, but are you sure it needs to be this complicated?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Of course! And I know we can pull it off! Sorry, Twilight. I don't have time to talk. We've got a lot more work to do before the coronation.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]

:'''Rarity''': Darling, change is an integral part of fashion. I myself am considering opening boutiques for non-ponies. Things must evolve, or they become stale. For example... I was just struck with a sudden inspiration to change my design for your gown by including the webs of these star spiders. They glow for a short while after they're spun. They won't have much time to weave the sash, but the effect will be dazzling. You see, darling? Change can be fabulous if you embrace it!

:[doors open]
:'''Spike''': Starlight is supposed to come over soon. There's a little something we wanted to give you before we leave. You know what? I think you're right, Twilight. I should take my comics to Canterlot. We can't leave the Power Ponies behind.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think the Power Ponies care, Spike. Just like all of our friends.
:'''Applejack''': All right, Twilight. Are you ready? We all wanted to see you off, but there's still a lot to do.
:'''Spike''': Aren't you coming on the train?
:'''Applejack''': I gotta go with Big Mac so we can go over our packin' list or we won't know who gets what deliveries.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And I'm gonna meet the Wonderbolts so we can go over the routine one last time.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm going with Gummy. He said he knows when the fireworks display should start, but does anypony really believe that?!
:'''Fluttershy''': And I still need to pick up food for the swans and doves who flew ahead to Canterlot. If I don't get them fed, they'll be too pooped to perform.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'll be living in Canterlot alone. Might as well take the train alone, too. Bye, I guess.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, you won't be traveling alone, darling. I'll have just enough time on the train to weave the star spider sash for your gown. But we should leave now. There's no time to dawdle if you want the coronation to be perfect.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's the problem! You're all so worried about making my coronation perfect, but I'm leaving Ponyville and none of you even care!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [gasp]

:'''Luster Dawn''': Exactly. You moved away, your friends didn't care, and that was that.
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, not exactly.

:'''Applejack''': Of course we care that you're movin', Twilight.
:'''Fluttershy''': I can't believe you'd think we don't.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What could possibly make you think that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I tried to talk to you all about how I was feeling, but you seemed more worried about what you had to do for the coronation.
:'''Spike''': It's true. I was there.
:'''Rarity''': I suppose it gave us something else to focus on.
:'''Applejack''': I knew you were worried about everything changin'. I guess I thought if I made it seem like everything was okay, it would be.
:'''Fluttershy''': I was just trying to make you feel better. That way ''I'' wouldn't feel so terrible.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Before I moved to Ponyville, I didn't really know what friendship was. You've all taught me so much. I can't believe it all might be ending. But when I imagine the future, all I can think about is that we won't be together! I'm literally moving away from you, and it's terrifying!
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm scared, too.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Me, too.
:'''Rarity''': Rattled to the core.
:'''Applejack''': Eeyup.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I wouldn't say scared.
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Buuuut just because I won't say it doesn't mean I don't feel it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm going to miss you so much!
:'''Rarity''': I just can't stop thinking about how much things are going to change!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': W... What if we don't see each other?
:'''Fluttershy''': What if we don't talk as much?
:'''Applejack''': What if we don't stay friends?!
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [crying]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know it's weird, but knowing you're all are as upset as I am actually makes me less worried.
:'''Spike''': That's nice, but you should be more worried about missing the train to Canterlot!
:[doors open]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sorry, I'm so late. I actually thought I'd missed you—
:'''Spike''': There's no time!
:[smack!]
:[thud]

:[train whistle blows]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no! We missed it! But maybe...
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. We're on the train. Everything should be fine, right?
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': I'd worked out exactly how much time I needed to weave my star spider sash, and now I'm behind!
:'''Applejack''': I hope Big Mac can figure out who gets what deliveries on his own.

:'''Savoir Fare''': I assume these contain the finest sparkling apple juice?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup!

:'''Baker Pony''': Ah, the Sweet Apple Acres applesauce for my coronation parfait! This is, uh, the applesauce?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Uhhh... eeyup?

:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] I don't have the snacks the doves and swans will need to perform after their long flight. I'd better find the food car.
:[star spiders screech]
:[hummingbirds tweet]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And I need to meet the Wonderbolts!
:[zoom!]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Where's the coronation team?
:'''Janitor Pony''': Well, they waited, but when you didn't show, they thought you must've meant to meet outside of Canterlot.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': The only thing I'm worried about is Gummy handling the fireworks display. But I'm sure it's fine. [nervous laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, it could always be worse.
:[brakes screech]
:[sheep baaing]

:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting]
:'''Princess Luna''': Goodness, Twilight. Are you all right?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My friends and I had a few hiccups on the way. But everything's fine now.
:[sheep baaing]
:'''Princess Celestia''': We really are both just so proud of you. If you need a moment, that's all right. It is ''your'' coronation.
:[trumpet fanfare]
:'''Princess Luna''': Although it would be nice to get started. Are you ready?
:'''Rarity''': ''NO!'' She can't possibly be crowned without wearing her coronation gown!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Very well. [to audience] Citizens of Equestria and beyond!
:[crowd cheering]
:[yaks stomping]
:[dragons breathing fire]
:'''Princess Celestia''': My sister and I have ruled this land for quite some time, but even ''we'' know that change eventually comes to us all. And though we know it can be unsettling, it's as natural as the rising and setting of the sun and the moon. Both of which my sister and I feel confident leaving in the hooves of the pony who will come after us.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpering]
:'''Rarity''': You look amazing. Ooh! I almost forgot!
:'''Princess Celestia''': And so without further ado, I give you the new ruler of Equestria - Princess Twilight Sparkle!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [yelps]
:[thud]
:'''Princess Celestia''': [gasps]
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry.
:[magic surges]
:[crowd ooh's]
:'''Princess Luna''': Um, Twilight?
:[birds chirp]
:[star spiders screech]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, dear. I know these aren't the snacks I promised, but it's all I could find.
:[swans honk]
:'''Spitfire''': Well, Dash or no Dash, Twilight's about to get that crown. Wonderbolts, roll out!
:[zoom!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No! Wait!
:[zoom!]
:[fireworks explode]
:[swans honk]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aah!
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Applejack''': To Twilight!
:[splat]
:[crowd murmuring]
:'''Princess Luna''': Hmm. Close enough.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpers]

:'''Luster Dawn''': Okay, I get it now. Your coronation was such a disaster that you and your friends never really recovered, and that's why you all drifted apart.
:'''Future Spike''': Well, you're half right.

:'''Luster Dawn''': So the coronation wasn't a disaster and your friendships just faded away over time?
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': Not exactly.
:[door opens]
:'''Future Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] Sorry I'm late. But it is so hard to find a sitter with a sense of humor for Li'l Cheese.
:[Boneless 6 squeaking]
:'''Future Rarity''': Honestly, I would have been here sooner, but you would ''not'' believe how busy Yakyakistan is these days.
:'''Future Rainbow Dash''': Maybe we could get to places on time if you let me do some of the chores instead of always doing everything yourself.
:'''Future Applejack''': Maybe I would if you did them the right way. Oh. Sorry. We're not the last ones, are we?
:'''Future Fluttershy''': Discord's headed to an ''O&O'' convention or he'd be joining us.
:'''Luster Dawn''': I just assumed that since you all aren't together all the time now—
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': That we aren't friends?
:'''Future Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [laugh]
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': That is not the point of my story. It's true my coronation was a disaster.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gulps] Well, at least the coronation is over.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [snickers]
:'''Mane Six''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That was something.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I was just about to say the same thing. I know maybe it wasn't the coronation you planned, but it's good to see all of you laughing.
:'''Spike''': We wanted to give this to you before you left Ponyville, but things got a little hectic.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Since you're moving away, we thought if you missed any of us or Ponyville, this might help.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Awww.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's a book of memories.
:'''Applejack''': And we all chipped in some.
:'''Fluttershy''': No matter how much things change, you'll always have this to look back on.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I love it. Thank you so much. But I don't want to only look back. Obviously the coronation wasn't perfect, but that doesn't matter. It's our relationships that really count, and we have to maintain them.
:'''Rarity''': But now that we'll be living in different places, I'm not exactly sure how.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I am. I suggest we meet once a moon. In fact, my first royal decree as ruler of Equestria is to establish this Council of Friendship!
:'''Mane Six''', '''Starlight Glimmer''', and '''Spike''': [cheer]
:'''Princess Celestia''': And what a wonderful decree it is!
:'''Princess Luna''': We always knew that whatever adversity you faced, you and your friends would find your way through it together.
:'''Princess Celestia''': We know Equestria is in the perfect hooves with you ''and'' your friends looking out for it. And while we'll always be here if you need us, it's time for us to be on our way.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're leaving?
:'''Princess Luna''': We hope you'll come and visit us in Silver Shoals.
:'''Princess Celestia''': But now it's time for you to rule on your own. You're all more than capable.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you. For everything. Mmmm! [chuckling]
:'''All''': [laughing]

:'''Luster Dawn''': So, even though everything changed and you moved away from your friends, you didn't grow apart? And this is the Council of Friendship? That's what you're all doing here?
:'''Future Rainbow Dash''': Duh! This time every moon.
:'''Future Applejack''': [chuckles] What she means is this is how we've been rulin' together.
:'''Future Rarity''': And how we've continued to face every problem and threat to Equestria over the years.
:'''Future Pinkie Pie''': But mostly, it's how we keep in touch. No matter how busy life gets.
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': Sometimes friendships can be hard, and it takes work to maintain them. But without friends, things can be a lot harder.
:'''Luster Dawn''': I never thought about friendship being something to work at, and I don't mind work. I guess if they don't have to fade away, maybe making friends isn't the waste of time I thought. But I've been so focused on my studies, I wouldn't know where to start.
:'''Future Twilight Sparkle''': That's all right, because I know exactly where to send you.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This happened while we were gone?
:'''Applejack''': Wow! Those are all the places we went when we left to save Equestria!
:'''Rarity''': Ugh! There's that horrid town where we were almost sold!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The pirates! They were pretty awesome! Uh, once they decided not to throw us overboard.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And Mount Aris! Ooh, Starlight! Did you know we made seashell necklaces for ''aaaaaa''... [inhales] ''...aaaaall'' the seaponies?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I... You... Really? What about that unicorn? The one who attacked Canterlot?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Tempest! I invited her to come to Ponyville, but she wanted to spread the word of the Storm King's defeat and share what she learned about friendship.
:'''Applejack''': Y'all think that's why the map grew? Friendship quests ''beyond'' Equestria?
:'''Fluttershy''': I hope not. I've had quite enough life-threatening adventures, thank you very much.
:[squeaking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': How many friendship quests do you think we need to go on before we have to expand the throne room?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We can't do it all alone.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure we can! We just need to knock this wall down, get some paint...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No. I mean, the world is filled with so many different creatures who know nothing about friendship. We need help if we're gonna teach them all about friendship. ''Lots'' of help.
:'''Rarity''': Perhaps. But where does one go to ''learn'' about friendship?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Here! They can all go here! Because we're gonna open a school!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Princess Celestia''': I think a school of friendship is a wonderful idea, Twilight! I'll help in any way I can.
:[scribbling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I just have a few questions. What time should school start each day?
:'''Princess Celestia''': It really d—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What's the ideal length for class? Do you test regularly?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, well, that's—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What about class projects?
:'''Princess Celestia''': That's a very—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Assigned seating? Open seating? Or is that... too unstructured?
:'''Princess Celestia''': [giggles] Oh, Twilight. You were my star pupil. If anyone knows how to run a school, it's you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There's a big difference between attending a school and running one. It's not like there's a rule book to follow.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Actually, there is. The EEA guidebook is very specific about how to run a school.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The EEA? I've never heard of that. Should I have heard of that?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Of course not. You've never run a school before. The Equestria Education Association is a board of learned ponies that oversee every school in Equestria.
:'''Spike''': Even your school? But you're you!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Not even a princess can do whatever she likes when it comes to shaping young pony minds. The EEA ensures that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, or Earth ponies researching agriculture, all schools are held to the same high standard. They'll need to approve your plan before you can move forward.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, Spike, looks like we have a presentation to make.
:'''Spike''': [scoffs] After everything we've been through, how hard can ''that'' be?

:[deep chord]
:'''Spike''': I'm gonna go with "really hard".
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, hello. My name is—
:'''Neighsay''': Princess Twilight Sparkle. I am Chancellor Neighsay. Equestria owes you a great debt. But princess or no, we expect you to do things by... the... book!
:[thud]
:[pages flipping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think you'll find my curriculum meets all your requirements, Chancellor.
:[pages flipping]
:'''Neighsay''': And can we trust you to follow through with this plan? Will you leave the school unattended to gallop off on your... "adventures"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My journey beyond Equestria showed me firsthoof that the threats out there are greater than we imagined!
:[EEA members hushed whispering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If we want to keep our land safe and create a friendlier tomorrow, we need to teach the Magic of Friendship far and wide.
:'''Neighsay''': A school for ''ponies'' to learn how to protect themselves.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, more like respecting differences and communicating.
:[long pause]
:'''Neighsay''': The EEA concurs. Every pony should be prepared to defend our way of life. So, if your work is in order, ''provisional'' EEA approval is granted. We will need to observe your school up and running before it can be fully accredited.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then please, join us for Friends and Family Day. It'll be the perfect time to see our progress!
:[stamp]

:[various glints]
:[splashing]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's too much. Too much!
:'''Rarity''': Ugh, you think so? I had hoped dressing the part would help me ''feel'' the part.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not your dress! This! Us! Teaching?! They're gonna think I'm an egghead!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, the students are gonna ''love'' my confetti cannon class. It's gonna be... a blast!
:[party cannon squeak]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, hello there. I'm your teacher. I hope you enjoy class. But if you don't enjoy it, that's okay, too.
:'''Applejack''': I don't know about all this.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's going to be fine. Everything about this school just feels right.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': See? If Twilight isn't stressed, you've got nothing to worry about.
:'''Applejack''': And you're sure you want ''us'' to be teachers? In classrooms?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The EEA is very clear on how schools should be run. We have a ''huge'' responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book. That means no cannons in class, Pinkie.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Awww. Not even a [high-pitched] teeny cannon?
:[tiny party cannon fires]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know it's not some big adventure against the forces of evil, but this could be the most important thing we've ever done. I can't run a school of friendship without my best friends. Can I count on you?
:'''Rarity''': Of course you can, darling.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Call me Professor Egghead. I'm in!
:[bell rings]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams] First day at school! So many new ponies!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': About that. One thing I forgot to mention. It's not just ponies.
:[students chattering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That was unexpected.

:'''Rarity''': Ooh! Students certainly traveled from far and wide to attend our school!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms. After all, friendship is something that needs to be shared with every... creature.
:[magic zap]
:[ponies chattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Welcome to the School of Friendship! I'm your headmare Twilight Sparkle. Please follow Guidance Counselor Starlight to sign in and get your class assignments. Then we can show you your living quarters.
:[thump]
:'''Sandbar''': Whoa, sorry! I'm Sandbar. Are you a student here, too?
:'''Gallus''': [sarcastically] No, I just figured I'd randomly stand here and see how many ponies would walk into me. [huffs]
:'''Grampa Gruff''': ''Gallus!'' [wheezes]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Grandpa Gruff? What are you doing here?
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Flew all the way from Griffonstone to introduce Gallus.
:'''Gallus''': Rainbow Dash, right? Gilda told me about you. You're a teacher? Huh. Thought you'd be... cooler.
:[door slams]
:'''Prince Rutherford''': ''Ponies!''
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Prince Rutherford!
:'''Prince Rutherford''': This Yona Yak. She come to pony school. Hah. Make it better.
:'''Yona''': Yak can't wait to meet ponies and tell all about Yakyakistan!
:[ponies screaming]
:'''Yona''': [yelps]
:[thud]
:[crash]
:'''Applejack''': Why don't I show you around before you destroy the place?
:'''Smolder''': But dragons are better than this! Why am I here?
:'''Ember''': Because as Dragon Lord, I'm ordering you to be here! Hey, Spike! Come meet Smolder.
:'''Spike''': Great to see you, Ember! Uh, which one is Smolder?
:[beat]
:'''Thorax''': Ocellus! What did we talk about?
:[changeling zap]
:'''Thorax''': I told you, stay in your own form. It's the polite thing to do. Sorry, she's shy.
:'''Silverstream''': What is ''that''?! No way! I didn't know ponies could turn into... um... What are you?
:'''Thorax''': A changeling.
:'''Silverstream''': Ponies can turn into changelings?!
:'''Fluttershy''': No, but changelings can turn into ponies.
:'''Silverstream''': Huh. That's confusing!
:[changeling zap]
:'''Seaspray''': I am General Seaspray of Her Majesty Queen Novo's navy. I would like to introduce the queen's niece, Silverstream.
:'''Silverstream''': This place is ''amazing!'' I've spent most of my life in a coral reef underwater. I was a seapony, but now I'm a Hippogriff. Long story. Anyway, ''wow!'' Is that a yak?!
:[ponies chattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you so much for supporting the grand opening of our school. I hope you'll all join us for Friends and Family Day to see the amazing progress your students are making.
:[cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Looks like school's in session!
{{#lst:School of Friendship (song)|song}}

:[students groaning]
:'''Silverstream''': Is this what boring is? Am I bored?
:'''Smolder''': Ugh, please. ''These'' ponies are the heroes of Equestria?
:'''Sandbar''': Listen, these ponies saved all of us from the Storm King.
:'''Gallus''': How? By ''boring'' him into surrender?
:'''Ocellus''': Our teachers are a little different than I expected.
:'''Yona''': Ugh! Pony school waste of time! Yak school teach how to braid yak hair! Braiding yak hair is best! Whoa!
:[thud]
:'''Smolder''': Oof! Is there anything in Yakyakistan that ''isn't'' the best?
:'''Yona''': ''Yes!'' Wait. ''No!'' Yaks best.
:'''Smolder''': No claws, no wings, no fire. What is it exactly you're proud of?
:'''Sandbar''': Whoa, cool it. No need to harsh Yona's love for her heritage, okay?
:'''Gallus''': Awww, are we not being sweet and friendly enough for you, ''pony''?
:'''Silverstream''': That was sarcasm, right? Because you weren't being sweet ''or'' nice!
:'''Smolder''': Maybe dragons and griffons are just too tough for friendship.
:'''Yona''': Yaks tough, just not nasty.
:'''Gallus''': Who you calling nasty, klutz?
:'''Gallus''' and '''Yona''': [grunting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Okay, break it up! Break... it... ''up!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What is going on here?!
:'''Gallus''': Just a ''friendly'' discussion about the magic of ''friendship'' amongst ''friends''.
:'''Applejack''': Everypony— I mean, every''one'', go to your next class! I just can't believe it. Fights breakin' out when they're supposed to be learnin' friendship?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Things definitely aren't going as "by the book" as Twilight planned.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's because we're terrible teachers! Face it. This school isn't gonna work.

:'''Applejack''': [fading in] ...fights breakin' out in the hallway...
:[other main characters talking over each other]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ...putting myself to sleep!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't look like that, do I?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [snores]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I get it. Things are getting off to a rougher start than expected. But that's okay!
:'''Spike''': Who are you, and what have you done with Twilight Sparkle?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Every school in Equestria follows these rules. As long as we do too, we'll be fine.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Maybe we should... try something new?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The EEA will be here this afternoon for Friends and Family Day. They need to see a school that follows their guidelines.
:'''Fluttershy''': Even if those guidelines aren't working?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, then we have to try harder and make sure they do.
:[bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Another morning, another chance to inspire our students!
:[door opens]

:'''Sandbar''': Hey! Professor Dash's class is this way.
:'''Ocellus''': Where are you going? You're not [gasps] ''skipping'', are you?
:'''Smolder''': That's exactly what we're doing.
:'''Silverstream''': But Friends and Family Day—
:'''Gallus''': Is ''after'' class. Relax. This is just a quick... mental health break.
:'''Ocellus''', '''Silverstream''', and '''Yona''': [whispering]
:'''Silverstream''': That sounds legit! We're in!
:'''Sandbar''': I guess I'll tag along, too. Make sure you don't get into... trouble.
:[students giggling]
:'''Fluttershy''': This way, Angel!
:'''Silverstream''': Professor Fluttershy! We're ''busted!''
:[changeling zap]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my! What are you all doing? Aren't classes that way?
:{{H:title|as Rarity|'''Ocellus'''}}: Ah— [clears throat] A generosity field trip, daaaaarling. [giggles] I'm taking the students to the lake to look at our ''divine'' reflections.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, that sounds nice. Have fun!
:'''Angel''': [growls]
:[changeling zap]
:[students giggling]
:'''Smolder''': I take back everything I said about you! That was cool!
:'''Ocellus''': Thanks! Wait, what did you say about me?
:[students giggling]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You're sure sticking to the book is gonna work?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My friends can handle anything. They'll have these problems turned around before we know it.
:'''Neighsay''': Problems?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Chancellor Neighsay! You're here!
:'''Neighsay''': Yes. And you seem unprepared. If there are problems...
:[scribbling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Problems? Ha! Of course not! We can't wait to show you around!
:[scribbling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chuckles nervously]

:'''Gallus''': And that's why griffons breathe fire when we get mad.
:'''Silverstream''': They do not! Wait! Do they? No! Really?!
:'''Yona''': Griffons just full of hot air!
:[students laughing]
:'''Smolder''': And yaks are actually good at jokes. How about that?
:'''Ocellus''': What are dragons good at?
:'''Smolder''': Competition! Who's up for a race?

:[skidding brakes]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow Dash! Why aren't you in class teaching?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Because my students are gone! Uh, g-gone somewhere else! Doing a loyalty lesson! And-and I was just going to grab, uh... this pencil! Because they need it. Wherever they are. Which I know, 'cause... I'm the teacher!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I see. [laughs nervously] Well, Chancellor, we have other classes. We can just—
:'''Neighsay''': Let's follow the professor. I'm quite curious about this lesson in loyalty.

:[students laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [voiceover] Of course, we want to instill a sense of loyalty towards others. We encourage acts of generosity and kindness.
:[students yelping]
:'''Gallus''': Figured we shouldn't be the only ones enjoying the view.
:'''Yona''': Waaaah! Yak not best at flying!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [voiceover] And appreciation for the value of laughter...
:'''Yona''': Flying is ''best!''
:'''Silverstream''': Congratulations, Yona! You are officially the ''weirdest'' thing I've seen so far!
:'''Smolder''': What do you say, Ocellus? Can you be weirder than a flying yak?
:[changeling zap]
:[other students gasping]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...and to always be honest in any situation.
:'''Neighsay''': Honesty is imperative. Princess, are we going in circles?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, look at the time! We'd better head to the lake for Friends and Family Day. I'm sure all the students and faculty will be there.

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Prince Rutherford''': [laughs]
:[clink]
:[buzzing noise]
:'''Ember''': What is ''that''?!
:[shocked noises and screams]
:'''Neighsay''': Aah! The school is under attack!
:'''Gallus''': [grunts]
:[spinning]
:'''Silverstream''' and '''Smolder''': [gasps]
:'''Yona''': [screams]
:[splat]
:'''Pony''': Oh, my goodness!
:[changeling zap]
:[crunch]
:[all coughing]
:'''Silverstream''': Uh, maybe skipping class wasn't the best idea?
:'''Neighsay''': How dare you! This act of aggression against ponies—!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I-I'm so sorry, Chancellor. We clearly had some students get a little carried away.
:'''Neighsay''': ''Those'' are students? But you said you were opening this school to ''protect'' Equestria! To defend ponies from... dangerous creatures who don't have our best interests at heart!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My school teaches for all of us to work together through friendship.
:'''Neighsay''': And how do you know these ''creatures'' won't take what they have learned here and use it against us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Friendship isn't just for ponies!
:'''Neighsay''': It should be.
:'''Prince Rutherford''': Unicorn think yaks no need friendship? Maybe yaks no need pony school!
:'''Neighsay''': Well, perhaps you should return to ''your kind''.
:'''Ember''': "Your kind"?! Smolder, let's go!
:'''Seaspray''': Queen Novo will want to hear of this!
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Well, this place seemed lame anyways.
:'''Thorax''': [despondently] It's fine. We know not every pony sees us the way you do. We're used to it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms! When she hears you closed the school because—!
:'''Neighsay''': Because ''you'' failed to meet the EEA's standards?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?!
:'''Neighsay''': Irresponsible teachers, students skipping class, endangering ponies! Your school is a disaster. Perhaps if you had had higher standards for who was admitted, this could have been avoided. Regardless...
:[magic noises]
:[chains rattling]
:'''Neighsay''': By order of the EEA, I am shutting this school... [stomps] down!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sad gasp]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This happened while we were gone?

:'''Applejack''': Friendship quests ''beyond'' Equestria?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're gonna open a school!

:'''Neighsay''': We expect you to do things by... the... book!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We have a ''huge'' responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book.

:'''Smolder''': ''These'' ponies are the heroes of Equestria?

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[phonograph playing sad music]
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Twilight? You feeling okay?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [muffled groan]
:[click, sad music stops]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [incoherent groan]
:'''Spike''': [sighs] Look on the bright side. Sure, the EEA closed your friendship school. But now you've got time to do other stuff! It's like being on vacation!
:[flumph]
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A failure vacation! I'm supposed to be the Princess of Friendship! And all I did was make enemies with Equestria's allies, upset my friends, and get my school... [eye twitches] ...unaccredited! There is no bright side! [blows nose]
:'''Spike''': Okay, then. I'm gonna need backup. Operation Cheer-Up is a go!
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Twilight! You can't sit around in the boring dark all day!
:'''Applejack''': Exactly! What you need is a double dose of Granny Smith's apple mash.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': Whenever I'm sad, a hug from Angel Bunny always makes me feel better.
:'''Angel''': [squeaks] [whimpers]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! Uh... Maybe it's just me. [laughs nervously]
:'''Rarity''': I find that nothing brightens my mood like a new ensemble!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs, still tearing up] Thanks, Rarity. It's a great dress... [sobs] for somepony who knows how to run a school! [blows nose]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whispering, to Spike] You didn't tell me this was a ''pity'' party! I would've brought ice cream!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I appreciate you trying to make me feel better, but not everything can be fixed with dresses and cupcakes.
:'''Rarity''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''What?!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I just need some time to be alone and think.
:[doors close]

:[waterfall rushing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I wondered how long you'd take to get tired of pillow-fort pouting.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Everypony's already tried to cheer me up. It won't work.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [short laugh] I'm not gonna cheer you up. I'm gonna tell you what you did wrong.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You gave up too easily.
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hey, you made me a guidance counselor. That means tough love.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Neighsay was right. I failed. The school ''was'' a disaster.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So was I when you met me. But you showed me that when you know in your heart something is right, you stand up for it. You did that for me. Why not for this?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't go against the EEA! They're in charge of all the schools in Equestria!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And ''you're'' in charge of all the ''friendship'' in Equestria. Why should you let somepony else stop you from doing your job?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But the EEA rulebook—
:[splash]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Doesn't matter! You can write your own rules! Because you are doing something new. Something important!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're right! ''Why'' we're doing this is way more important than ''how'' we're doing this! And we ''are'' doing this!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Now, ''that's'' the Twilight I know. How can I help?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You already have.

:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Guess what? The School of Friendship is back in business!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?!
:'''Rarity''': But why?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, no.
:'''Applejack''': Bad idea.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Do we still get to guess?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No offense, Twilight, but teaching at that school was the most boring, horrible, awful thing ever.
:'''Applejack''': Uh, pretty sure she's gonna take offense to that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, Rainbow Dash is right. I owe you all an apology. I was so focused on doing things the EEA way, I didn't listen to any of you. I'm sorry. I promise, this time, we'll run the school the way friends should – together.
:'''Rarity''': So... we'd be allowed to teach however ''we'' want to?
:'''Fluttershy''': No more scary pop quizzes?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Confetti cannons for everycreature?
:[party cannons clanking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whatever you need to teach the Elements of Harmony.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yippeeeee!
:[party cannons fire]
:'''Applejack''': Well, in that case, we're behind you one hundred percent, Twilight.
:'''Spike''': [clears throat] Just two small problems. The school is still unaccredited...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [eye twitches]
:'''Spike''': ...''and'' we don't have any students.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'll take care of the first part if you five can round up our class.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Totally! Uh... how?
:'''Applejack''': Roundin' up the pony students ain't gonna be an issue, but...
:'''Fluttershy''': The creatures from the other kingdoms seemed pretty upset with us.
:'''Rarity''': Pfft! Nonsense! I'm certain we can win them over with our charm and style!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [singsongy] Cupcake-gram for Prince Rutherfoooord!
:'''Prince Rutherford''': Why pink pony here? Yaks mad at ponies!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Because... you don't have to be mad anymore! We're reopening Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship! And it's gonna be super-uper-duper better than before! We're—
:'''Rarity''': —ever so sorry about the misunderstanding. All creatures are, of course, welcome.
:'''Fluttershy''': We would be really happy if you sent your student back to class.
:'''Applejack''': It won't be the same without 'em. We're open and ready to start teachin'—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': —right now! So, what are you waiting for? Get your student and let's go!
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Not happenin'!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] Do you need me to do the whole apology and explanation thing ''again''? Okay. [inhales]
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Listen, missy! It's not happenin' because—
:'''Grampa Gruff''', '''Ember''', '''Prince Rutherford''', '''Seaspray''', and '''Thorax''': [simultaneously] Our student is ''gone!''
:'''Applejack''', '''Fluttershy''', '''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', and '''Rarity''': [simultaneously] ''What?!''

:'''Prince Rutherford''': ''Where Yona?! This all pony's fault!''
:'''Ember''': You're pretty quick to blame them! What are you hiding, yak?!
:'''Prince Rutherford''': [snorts]
:'''Thorax''': C-Can... Can we just focus on finding our lost students?
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Nice try! You grubs are probably hidin' the whole lot of 'em!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Please, everycreature! If you can just explain what happened...
:'''Seaspray''': The students left us notes before they disappeared. When the school closed, they didn't want to say goodbye to each other. They claim they ran away to stay together.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe it! They ''did'' learn friendship!
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry.
:'''Seaspray''': The students couldn't have done this by themselves. Some creature is hiding them! If the niece of our queen is not found soon, I promise there will be retribution!
:'''Ember''': Yeah? Well, my dragons will burn every kingdom until we find which of you is hiding Smolder!
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Tell it to the griffon army!
:'''Prince Rutherford''': Yaks fight griffons ''and'' dragons!
:'''Thorax''': The Changeling Empire can't afford an international incident. If any creature blames the changelings for this—
:'''Ember''': What are you up to, shapeshifter?!
:'''Thorax''': B-But we're friends!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Find the students quickly, Twilight, or I fear our world will be at war!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. Let's review what we know.
:'''Spike''': Smolder, Ocellus, Silverstream, Yona, and Gallus disappeared together.
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': That's all we know.
:'''Applejack''': They're probably just off hidin' somewhere.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Unless they used some kind of spell to disappear.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ooh! Or went undercover!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe they were attacked by a ferocious shrimp! Nopony ''ever'' expects that!
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Shrimps can attack?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nope! That's why nopony expects it.
:[door opens, bell rings]
:'''Sandbar''': Whoa!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hi, Sandbar! Are you having a party?
:'''Sandbar''': [incredibly nervously] No! I'm just, um... ''really'' hungry? Yeah?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [squee]
:'''Rarity''': We need to think like our students. If someone told us we would never see each other again, what would we do?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Go someplace we could all hang out and eat lots and lots of cupcakes!
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?
:'''Fluttershy''': Sandbar was friends with all of the missing students... and he just got plenty of cupcakes.
:'''Applejack''': Huh. He was at the farm this mornin' pickin' up a wagonload of apples...
:'''Rarity''': And I saw him in a shop buying pillows and blankets!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] He must be taking all that stuff to the other students! We've gotta follow him!
:[smack]

:'''Gallus''': [laughing] Huh. This place is ''way'' cooler than I thought it'd be.
:[thud]
:'''Smolder''': [chewing] Even I'm impressed. What's it called again, Ocellus?
:'''Ocellus''': The Castle of the Two Sisters. I remembered it from class. Princess Twilight's "History of Pre-Equestrian Friendships".
:'''Gallus''': Huh. Who knew? School was actually good for something.
:'''Yona''': Yona not really like school. But Yona like new friends!
:'''Smolder''': [grunts] [strained] Smolder... like breathing!
:'''Silverstream''': Hey, you guys! Sandbar's back!
:[thump]
:[door opens]
:'''Yona''': Cupcakes are best cakes!
:'''Sandbar''': Aah!
:'''Yona''': [panting]
:'''Sandbar''': [sighs] Thanks for the assist, Gallus.
:'''Gallus''': [scoffs] I was saving the cupcakes. [chewing]
:'''Ocellus''': Pillows! How nice! The castle is gonna be so much more comfy.
:'''Smolder''': And fun! Pillow fight!
:'''Smolder''' and '''Sandbar''': [grunting and laughing]
:[buzzing]
:[thump]
:[students laughing]
:'''Silverstream''': ''You guys!'' I just found ''stairs!''
:[beat]
:'''Gallus''': Aaaand we care because...?
:'''Silverstream''': Stairs are awesome! We don't have anything like 'em underwater, 'cause you know, [magic zap] no way to climb 'em!
:'''Rest of students''': Ohhhh.
:[magic zap]
:'''Silverstream''': This place has everything! If only my family back home could see it...
:[thump]
:'''Silverstream''': [chewing]
:'''Ocellus''': I wish the other changelings could meet you all. You're not nearly as strange as the stories say.
:'''Smolder''': Gee, thanks. But yeah, hanging out with other creatures is actually... not bad.
:[rustling]
:[thump]
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, most other creatures. What is that thing?
:'''Ocellus''': [sighs] Am I the ''only'' one who didn't sleep through Professor Fluttershy's "Critters of Comfort and Conflict" class? It's a puckwudgie. Maybe I can make friends with it!
:[changeling zap]
:'''Ocellus''': [puckwudgie noises]
:[puckwudgie growls]
:[more puckwudgies growling]
:[changeling zap]
:'''Ocellus''': Oops.
:'''Yona''': Yak plan better. [screams battlecry]
:[needles flying]
:[thunk]
:[puckwudgie snarling]
:[needles flying]
:[puckwudgie noises]

:[puckwudgie noises]
:'''Smolder''': [grunts]
:[needles flying]
:[flumph]
:'''Smolder''': Think, Ocellus! Did Professor Fluttershy say anything about how to ''beat'' puckwudgies in her lecture?!
:'''Ocellus''': Uh... I'm sorry, I can't remember!
:'''Gallus''': I'm gonna go ahead and guess it's not pillows, apples—
:[needles flying]
:'''Gallus''': ...or cupcakes.
:'''Silverstream''': Wouldn't class have been about how to make friends with them?
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, guys? They're getting really close...
:'''Yona''': Yona not scared! Yona have friends!
:[puckwudgies gnashing]
:[whoosh]
:'''Gallus''': Is that Professor Egghead?!
:[magic noises]
:'''Spike''': Aw, yeah!
:[puckwudgie noises]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! Don't hurt them! Just ask them to leave nicely.
:[thunk]
:[fuse burning]
:[party cannon fires]
:[fireworks exploding]
:'''Yona''': Not bad! [quickly] For pony.
:'''Ocellus''': Wow! They're amazing!
:'''Gallus''': I had no idea our teachers were actually cool.
:'''Sandbar''': [chuckles] I've been trying to tell you!
:'''Silverstream''': Did you see that?! Rainbow Dash was like ''voooooom'' and then ''werrrrr'', and the puckwudgies went flying! And then the birds came and—!
:'''Smolder''': Yeah, we all just lived it. But you're right. That was pretty amazing. Even by dragon standards.
:[puckwudgie noises]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is everycreature alright?
:'''Students''': [general agreement]
:'''Spike''': [panting] You're lucky we got here in time!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You know, this probably isn't the safest place for a campout.
:'''Ocellus''': Does that mean you're going to send us back to our homes?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not exactly. We have another option in mind.
:'''Gallus''': We're listening.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's pretty clear you've already started learning friendship without your teachers. But we'd like to show you even more... if you'd come back to school?
:'''Smolder''': Not much of a choice.
:'''Applejack''': To be honest, we felt exactly the same way when Twilight told us she was reopening the school.
:'''Rarity''': But this time, we guarantee it shall be different.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, yeah! With class run my way, it'll be ''two hundred'' and twenty percent cooler.
:'''Fluttershy''': And without the EEA—
:[puckwudgie noise]
:'''Fluttershy''': —it'll be much friendlier.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Plus, all your nations won't go to war if you come back with us! Bonus!
:[beat]
:'''Sandbar''': Wait. What's happening?

:[magic noises]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight! I was so relieved to get your letter!
:'''Seaspray''': As was Queen Novo. Oh, we're just glad you're alright, Silverstream!
:'''Grampa Gruff''': [to Gallus] Don't expect a welcome party from me, sonny! It's time you got home!
:[smack]
:'''Gallus''': I'm not leaving.
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Whaaaat?!
:'''Ocellus''': None of us are. Sorry, Thorax.
:'''Prince Rutherford''': Yak not understand. This pony joke?
:'''Smolder''': No. We're going back to school.
:'''Ember''': How? You can't even get inside!
:[magic noises]
:[chains shattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': School is back in session!
:'''Students''': [cheering]
:[magic warbling]
:'''Neighsay''': Who dared remove my seal?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I did, Chancellor Neighsay! And I respectfully ask you to step aside, or classes will start late.
:'''Neighsay''': Classes won't start at all! The EEA has spoken, and none shall pass!
:[boom!]
:'''Yona''': Yak pass if yak say! Hmph!
:'''Neighsay''': This is for the greater good. The school was disorganized, the teachers unqualified! And those dangerous and unpredictable "students" put ponies' lives in danger!
:'''Prince Rutherford''': [growls]
:'''Ember''': [growls] I'll show you unpredictable!
:'''Grampa Gruff''', '''Ember''', '''Prince Rutherford''', '''Seaspray''', and '''Thorax''': [shouting]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Hold on, please! I'm sure Princess Twilight Sparkle has a good explanation for all of this.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I do! It's true that my School of Friendship is EEA-unaccredited...
:'''Spike''': Look! She said it without doing the eye thing!
:'''Neighsay''': Then it is ''not'' a school!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's not an ''EEA'' school. It's a friendship school with its ''own'' rules. I should know. ''I'' wrote the book!
:[thump]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': These students reminded me that every friendship is special, so the way we teach it has to be just as unique. My school is going to do things differently.
:'''Neighsay''': Allowing all of these creatures to attend your school, changing the rules for ''them'' – it simply won't work!
:'''Princess Celestia''': I seem to recall something about Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi doing something similar, don't you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I promise you, Chancellor. My school ''will'' help protect Equestria.
:'''Neighsay''': Or destroy it!
:[magic noise]
:[students cheering]
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Hmph. How is this school going to be any different from last time?
{{#lst:Friendship Always Wins|song}}
:'''Ember''': Ugh, fine! If you promise to stop singing, Smolder can stay!
:'''Smolder''': Wahoo!
:'''Prince Rutherford''': Uh, if dragon stay, yak stay.
:'''Thorax''': I know you will make the changelings proud, Ocellus.
:'''Seaspray''': You belong here. Now, can you show me those stair things you mentioned?
:'''Silverstream''': [incoherent excited noises]
:'''Grampa Gruff''': [to Gallus] What? You belong at home! You think I care if you've made friends?
:'''Gallus''': Please, Grandpa Gruff? [whimpers]
:'''Grampa Gruff''': Alright, alright! Stop doing that!
:[students cheering]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Guess I make a pretty good guidance counselor, huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes! Writing the rulebook was the most fun ever! I can't wait to start working on the new lesson plans!
:'''Applejack''': [clears throat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...with some help from my friends.

:'''Meadow Song''': Puh-leeeez put your hooves together for your next performer, Maud Pie!
:[applause]
:'''Maud Pie''': [taps on microphone] [deadpan] What do you call an Alicorn with no wings and no horn?
:[beat]
:'''Maud Pie''': Earth pony.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs]
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] But seriously, being an Earth pony isn't so bad. We've got magic powers, too. Like walking around and picking stuff up with our teeth.
:[confused murmuring]
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] That's sarcasm, by the way.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] It's funny, 'cause it's true!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] My favorite thing to listen to is clastic rock – the accumulation of sediments over millennia forming to create sandstone, shale, and breccia. It sounds something like this.
:[feedback]
:[beat]
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] And that's my time.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] Isn't my sister Maud the most hilarious, entertaining, amazing comedian ever?
:[beat, ponies burst into uproarious laughter]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Your jokes, your hilarious delivery, your... your everything!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] How was my... timing?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughing] You got me! C'mon, let's celebrate sister-style. We can get matching stickers that says "Eyes on the Pies", then show them off at the Ponyville Sticker Convention that I could plan for tomorrow if you want.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Actually, I'm busy tonight.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aww, that's what you said yesterday. And the day before that. And the day ''before'' the day before that. [sighs] It's just, we haven't hung out in a really long time because you always have other plans. Even when you promised to build whipped-cream pyramids with me.
:[spraying]
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I know. I am sorry, Pinkie. The reason is I have a—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Apology accepted, as long as we get some serious sister time before your birthday. And there's, uh, definitely no reason I wanna hang out before your birthday. Just, you know, not planning anything special.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Okay.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What about tomorrow morning?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Okay.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yay! Just you and me. Best sister friends forever!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Best sister friends forever.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I can't wait for tomorrow to be today. [extended squeal]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [continues squealing] Tomorrow is today! Who's ready for some fun times at Sugarcube Corner? The answer is "you"! I would also accept "Maud". Maud? Maud!
:[echoes]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Oh, I get it! We're playing hide-and-go-seek!

:[music]
:[barrel clattering]

:[splashing]

:[zoom]
:[thud]

:[knock, knock, knock, knock]
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aha! Found you!
:[crash]
:[clattering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Where's Maud? I've already tried Discord's dimension, Granny Smith's wax museum, and Yakyakistan! She has to be here!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Nope, it's just me. Reading.
:[pages flipping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Story checks out. Or ''does'' it?! It does. But are you sure there's nopony hiding... ''in your closet?!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Pinkie, I don't ''have'' a closet. Is everything okay?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No. I was supposed to go birthday cake shopping with Maud today.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And ruin her surprise party?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I wasn't gonna tell her ''why'', silly. But now I can't even ''find'' Maud. I'm usually ''way'' better at hide-and-seek than this.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, she probably just found a new rock formation and forgot you two were gonna hang out. Tell ya what. You take care of the cake, and I'll look for Maud.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Really? Thanks, Starlight!
:[flowerpot clattering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Just checking.

:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whispering] I've gotta get very important ingredients for a very important pony's cake. And it's gotta be tippy-top super-duper secret.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, it's not your turn yet.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to cut in front of anypony.
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Um, whatcha doin'?
:'''Mudbriar''': I am currently speaking to a pony at a baking supply shop two minutes before it closes for lunch.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Rrrrrright. Okay. Just that I'm trying to plan a party here, and the clock is ticking, while you, uh... What ''are'' you doing anyway?
:'''Mudbriar''': I am currently speaking to a—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I mean, can I help you move this along? What are you looking for? Rolling pins, cupcake tins, cookie cutters with tails and fins?
:'''Mudbriar''': [to S06E12 Unnamed Unicorn Mare #3] Goodbye.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''That's'' what you've been standing here all this time to say?
:'''Mudbriar''': I was deciding between "goodbye" and "see you later".
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uh... but, they're the same thing.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, they're very different. "See you later" implies an event in the near future wherein we see each other. "Goodbye" expresses good wishes where parting or at the end of a conversation.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yyyyyeah, same thing.
:'''Mudbriar''': I will not apologize for speaking with precision.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': In that case, apology not accepted. Goodbye, later, see ya—same thing!
:[door slams]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ugh! Can you believe that guy?! Huh? "Out to Lunch"?! Oh, come on!
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans] No Maud, no cake, no anything! And how annoying was that pony? Who takes so long to say goodbye? Or was it "see ya later"? Ugh! Now he's got ''me'' doing it!
:[bump]
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Hello, Pinkie Pie.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maud! Found you! My turn to hide! Hee-hee!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I'm sorry I wasn't around this morning.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, pssh. What are you apologizing to ''me'' for? I'm not upset, you silly-willy.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] The reason is I met somepony—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wanna hang out right now? I mean, I can see you're not doing anything with anypony else. Unless they're invisible or reeeeeaaaally small.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Pinkie, the reason I've been so busy is that I have a boyfriend now.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': A wha...?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] A boyfriend.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': A whaaa...?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] A boyfriend.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': A whaaaaa...?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] A boyfriend.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's so exciting! My sister, in love!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Technically, we're in "like".
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Tell me everything! Who is he? What's his favorite color? Does he like ice cream? If he were a bird, what kind of bird would he be? Wait. Is he ''actually'' a bird? Oh! I don't know, because you haven't told me anything yet!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You'll like him. We have a lot in common.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, I love ''you'', so I know I'm gonna love your boyfriend! Oh, I can't wait to meet him!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You don't have to.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] He's a rock! And you love rocks, so it's perfect! [gasps] Is Boulder jealous?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] No. Behind the rock. Mudbriar, are you back there?
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, not anymore.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] A wha-''whaaaaaaaaa''?!

:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Pinkie Pie, meet Mudbriar.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, we've already met.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You?!
:'''Mudbriar''': M'yes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You?
:'''Mudbriar''': M'yes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You...
:'''Mudbriar''': M'yes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I mean, [laughs] you! You, you, you!
:'''Mudbriar''': M'yes. M'yes. M'yes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm sorry. Let's start over. Hi, I'm Maud's sister, Pinkie Pie.
:'''Mudbriar''': I know.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sooooo... how did... you two meet?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] At a rock show.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! You're into rocks, too?
:'''Mudbriar''': No. I like sticks.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Then why were you at a rock show?
:'''Mudbriar''': It was a petrified wood show, which technically makes it a stick show.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpanly happy] Except that in the per-mineralization process of petrification, all organic material is replaced with silicates – i.e., rocks.
:'''Mudbriar''': While retaining the original structural elements of wood – q.e.d., it was a stick show.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm... really into sticks, too! They're great for hitting piñatas! Haaaaa...
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Pinkie...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! You wanna go first?
:'''Mudbriar''': That is stick abuse.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It is? I'm sorry. Oh, this is awful. I'm not being a very good sister. Let's start over. I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, we've already met.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You should introduce Pinkie to your pet.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh! Your pet likes fetch!
:'''Mudbriar''': This ''is'' my pet. So no.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpanly happy] Aw. Look at Twiggy and Boulder playing together.
:'''Mudbriar''': They're adorable.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whispering, to Maud] It's just a stick.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Don't be rude.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. One more time. I'm Pinkie Pie! [through gritted teeth] Nice to meet you!
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, we've already met.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [growls, snort]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [straining] Daaah! I don't get this guy!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow. Maud has a boyfriend?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans] How could she like someone so weird? He has an inanimate object for a pet!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So does Maud.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Boulder has ''ten'' times the personality of some random stick! Mudbriar, too, for that matter. He's not like Maud at all! Maud is hilarious, friendly, caring, and easy to talk to!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yep, that's Maud.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But ''this'' guy is awkward, quiet, and kind of... strange.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, that also sounds like Maud.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughs] You're so funny, Starlight! Maud is ''nothing'' like Mudbriar. If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, Maud obviously likes ''something'' about him.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [groans]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Maybe you just need to spend more time with him. Find out what you have in common.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's easy – nothing!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You both care about Maud. I know. He could help you with her party.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I guess...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And I'll keep Maud busy while you and Mudbriar plan the best surprise birthday ever.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''That'' I can do!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Listen. Maud's birthday is tomorrow, and there's no time to waste. You're not afraid of slides, are you?
:'''Mudbriar''': No. Whyyyyyyyyyyy??!
:[crash]
:'''Mudbriar''': Oof!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No reason. Wheeeeeee!
:[crash]
:'''Mudbriar''': [groans]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Welcome to my party planning cave!
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, due to the speleothems growing from the ceiling, this is more of a cavern than a cave. Maud taught me that.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, okay.
:[squeaking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Here's what I'm thinking for her surprise party – edible rock candy plates, gem-shaped ice cubes, a pebble piñata. Uh... we'll skip that one.
:'''Mudbriar''': Might I make some suggestions?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. Suggest away! That's why you're here! You and me! Planning... together! Friends!
:'''Mudbriar''': I have a vision board of everything Maud loves, and none of those things are on it.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmph. Let me see this "vision board".
:'''Mudbriar''': It's not a physical thing. I'm envisioning it. [quietly] Om, I enter through the large door of my mind palace and enter to the back, where I have all of my books and possessions, and what do I encounter? The Maud Room. None of those things are there. [out loud] Just as I thought. Maud doesn't like surprises.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Where does it say that? She never told me that!
:'''Mudbriar''': Mmm. It sounds like she was protecting your feelings. She's very caring that way.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Stop acting like you know my sister better than me!
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, I never said that.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [angrily] Well, technically, I don't care! And since I've been best sister friends forever with Maud my entire life, I think ''I'm'' the expert here! Oh, but fine. If you don't believe me, let's ask her! [whispering] But we have to be super-sneaky.
:'''Mudbriar''': Can you be more specific?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Huh. You must be Mudbriar.
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you. I've heard great things!
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together. So... how's it going?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mudbriar and I have just spent the best time bonding! And we're really starting to make some headway becoming besties, except for one teensy-weensy disagreement that maybe you could settle, Maud. See, Mudbriar here seems to think that [starting to laugh] you don't like surprise parties! Isn't it funny how [suddenly angry] ''wrong he is?!''
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I like surprise parties...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmmmm.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] ...because I know they make you happy when you throw them for me.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': See? Wait, what?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I'd rather just do something small with you, Starlight, Boulder, and Mudbriar for my birthday.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No party? No party?! Did he put you up to this?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Mm-mm.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [whispering] Maybe you should consider, I don't know, taking things a little less serious with Mudbriar because he's kinda sort of... [loudly] ''impossible to like?!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hey, Mudbriar, have you ever flown a kite? Let me tell you all about it. See, the first thing you should do is—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I just can't believe you would choose sitting around with him over a party with your own sister!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] I didn't ''choose'' either of you. Technically, I said I wanted to be with both of you.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] "Technically"?! Ugh, you even like the way he ''talks''?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Everything about him makes me happy.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] [tearing up] Then I guess you don't need a best sister friend forever anymore.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpanly concerned] Pinkie...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, wait, let's all slow down and talk about this.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''No!'' [crying]
:'''Mudbriar''': See you later!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': [crying] I don't understand! How could Maud like Mudbriar? Is it Opposite Day? Nothing makes sense!
:'''Fluttershy's apparition''': ''I'm not shy, and I hate animals!''
:'''Rarity's apparition''': ''Fashion?! Not for me, darling!''
:'''Applejack's apparition''': ''Peh! An apple a day is downright disgusting!''
:'''Rainbow Dash's apparition''': ''Slow and steady wins the race!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle's apparition''': ''I never learned to read!''
:'''Mane five's apparitions''': [laughing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What if I don't like cupcakes?! [screams]

:[rooster crows]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Good morning! Oh, wait. ''Bad'' morning. [groans]
:[door opens]
:'''Limestone Pie''': Get out of bed, sis. If you're gonna be here, you gotta work.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ohhh.

:[pickaxe clinking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're probably wondering why I came back to the family farm in the middle of the night.
:'''Marble Pie''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, it all started when—
:'''Limestone Pie''': Less talking, more farming!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sad groan] It's just... Maud has a boyfriend.
:'''Limestone Pie''': I'm not jealous! Who said anything about jealous?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't be! He's super-duper weird! And somehow, he tricked Maud into liking him. And now I'll never get to see her again! [sighs] I came home because you two know her better than anypony. What am I missing? What does she see in him? [tearing up] What does he have that I don't?! [starts bawling]
:'''Limestone Pie''': Buck up, Pinkie Pie. You look as miserable as I feel ''all the time''.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sniffs]
:[splash]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's just that I love Maud, and I ''want'' to love Mudbriar, but I can't see anything to like about him!
:[beat]
:'''Limestone Pie''': Ugh, fine! We're taking a work break. Come on!

:'''Limestone Pie''': I'm looking at a sparkling bright blue and white rock. See it?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You mean that lumpy grey one?
:'''Limestone Pie''': No, the beautiful blue and white one. Right there.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I would not describe that as beautiful, blue, ''or'' white, but... [laughs nervously] Okay.
:'''Limestone Pie''': [to Marble] Show her.
:[rock cracks]
:[glistening]
:'''Limestone Pie''': It's a geode! The outside looks like a regular rock, but the inside is filled with beautiful gems.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': So you're saying I should crack open Mudbriar like a rock! It all makes sense! No, wait. It doesn't.
:'''Limestone Pie''': It's a metaphor, Pinkie! You see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a gem. Even if you never see past his dullness, you ''can'' see how happy he makes Maud. And to a sister, that's all that matters.
:'''Marble Pie''': Mm-hmm!
:[rock clinks]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh, Limestone, Marble, thank you! I don't know what I'd do without you two! Pie pile!
:[thud]
:'''Limestone Pie''': Okay, okay! You're crushing me to gravel, Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I really owe Mudbriar an apology. [gasps] And I owe Maud a party! I just hope I'm not too late!

:[paper rustling]
:[whirring hooves]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I brought you an olive branch to say sorry. I was really unfair to you, and I'm ready to listen to your ideas for Maud's birthday, if you still want to plan it together.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, this isn't even an olive branch. It's a quercus, most likely castaneifolia.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''Oh, come on!'' [through gritted teeth] Sorry! Keeping it together...!
:'''Mudbriar''': And I ''love'' a good quercus. Friends?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Friends! Now, do you have any ideas for the party?
:'''Mudbriar''': There is one.

:[music]
:[ponies chattering]
:[door opens]
:'''Crowd''': Surprise!
:[indistinct talking]
:'''Background pony 1''': Can you believe this punch? Oh, it's so good!
:'''Background pony 2''': Another great party!
:'''Background pony 3''': I know!
:'''Background pony 4''': Yeah!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpanly happy] This is my favorite party ever.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It was all your amazing boyfriend's idea. He said the best present would be me throwing you a surprise party you didn't have to go to.
:'''Mudbriar''': Technically, it wasn't a surprise because she could see the pre-party preparations from up here.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [through gritted teeth] Technically... [normally] You're right!

:[birds chirping]
:[ducks quacking]
:'''Angel''': [growls]
:'''Fluttershy''': Don't worry, Angel, I won't forget you.
:'''Angel''': [munching]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] There's nothing so peaceful as a cuddly friends picnic.
:'''Rarity''': ''Fluttershy!''
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': [panting]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, goodness, Rarity! What's the matter?
:[screech]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, the better question would be, "What ''isn't'' the matter?"
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, dear. Do you wanna have some lettuce and talk about it?
:'''Rarity''': Uh... Oh! I would love to, darling, but I just don't have the time. The Canterlot Royal Fashion Show is practically upon us, and the cornerstone piece of my collection just isn't working!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, that sounds serious.
:'''Rarity''': Oh-ho-ho, it's serious. The entire collection is designed around it!
:'''Fluttershy''': Do you need help knitting? I've started making tea cozies. It's an elephant.
:[fabric ripping]
:'''Rarity''': Yes, well, I don't need help making clothes. Sassy Saddles is pitching in. Plus, I'll be pulling all ''three'' of my Manehattan assistants.
:'''Fluttershy''': All three? Does that mean you'll have to close Rarity For You?
:'''Rarity''': That's just it, darling. This is Manehattan's busiest shopping season, and I can't just close the shop. So I was hoping... you might consider running it?
:'''Fluttershy''': Of course. I'm happy to help. Though I'm surprised you picked ''me''.
:'''Rarity''': Well, I may have asked a few others.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sorry, but we've got a Wonderbolts show coming up.
:[zoom!]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sorry, but it's pie season and the pie orders are piling up.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, I've got a curriculum to make up.

:'''Applejack''': Nope.

:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnnope.

:[record scratches]

:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] My calendar's packed, but I hear Fluttershy's free. And you haven't asked Boulder.
:'''Rarity''': Uh... Oh?

:'''Rarity''': [chuckles] It doesn't matter who else I asked, because I couldn't be happier that you agreed to help!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[door opens]
:'''Fluttershy''': I think I forgot how big this shop was. How do you find anything?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, it's ''easy'' to track. The store is divided into sections – chic, classic, modern, sophisticated, avant-garde, traditional, and obtuse. And, of course, each section is divided by season, color, and price. It's a classic SCP system. Then it's just a little ringing ponies up...
:[cash register keys clacking]
:[ka-ching!]
:'''Rarity''': ...a little fluff and fold... ''Voilà!'' But, of course, that's the ''easy'' part.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] It is?
:'''Rarity''': Mm-hmm. As you well know, the real focus at Rarity For You is on the customer!
:[door opens, closes]
:'''Rarity''': Care to give it a try?
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, okay. [quietly] Hello. Um, welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?
:'''Pursey Pink''': I need something classic but modern. Something with drama but also understated.
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, aren't all those things opposites?
:'''Pursey Pink''': Yes. So?
:'''Fluttershy''': But how can I—?
:'''Pursey Pink''': I'm sorry. Are you asking ''me'' how to do ''your'' job?
:'''Fluttershy''': No! But I just, um—
:'''Rarity''': If I may, I'm thinking noir-esque minimalist but with a twist. Perhaps a tapered hem.
:[dramatic music]
:'''Pursey Pink''': [gasps] It's like you read my mind! Are you a fashion psychic? [laughs]
:'''Rarity''': Hmm. The inseams say, "Yes!"
:'''Rarity''' and '''Pursey Pink''': [laugh]
:[ka-ching!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Wow. You make it look so easy.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, come now. You've conquered your shyness a thousand times over. You can't let a few fashion ponies undo all that progress.
:'''Fluttershy''': I guess not.
:'''Rarity''': You simply must access your inner strength and allow it to shine through!
:'''Fluttershy''': How?
:'''Rarity''': Uh, daily affirmations? Meditation? Ooh! Power posing works wonders whenever ''I'' feel intimidated. Try these. Confident warrior! Gold medalist! Showpony!
:[creaking]
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': [clears throat] Or... not.
:'''Blue Bobbin''': We need to leave ''now'' if we're going to catch the train to Canterlot.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, goodness, look at the time! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, go, go! I'm right behind you!
:'''Fluttershy''': You're not gonna be here? In your work room?
:'''Rarity''': But, darling, I simply can't. The fashion show is in Canterlot tomorrow, and I'll be up all night, even with the help of all of my assistants!
:'''Fluttershy''': [gulps]
:'''Rarity''': Well, not ''all'' my assistants.
:'''Fluttershy''': Smoky! Softpad! Smoky Jr.!
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! [giggles]
:'''Rarity''': Ever since you convinced me to let them live in the shop, these beastie sweeties have been nothing but helpful.
:'''Fluttershy''': And I'm sure they'll help ''me'' let my inner strength shine through!
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I wish I could stay and offer more help. [gasps] Why not try a new outfit? Think of it as the costume for your role as... Shop Pony! Ha ha! You know what they say – "clothes make the pony".
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, ''who'' says that?
:'''Rarity''': You know, "them". All right. I'm sure you and your furry friends will do just fine. Ta-ta!
:[door opens, closes]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs] I hope she's right.
:[door opens, closes]
:'''Fluttershy''': Whew. Here goes nothing.
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': Welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?
:'''Bracer Britches''': What's the thread count of this shirt? I can't be seen in anything less than a thousand.
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, thread... count? Um... Well, I'm not sure. Let's see... Um, one, two, three, four...
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, excuse me for just one second. [pants]
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, I'm afraid I don't know much about fashion to satisfy these customers. What am I gonna do?
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, I've never tried to act before, but... I suppose it's worth a shot.

:'''Fluttershy''': [clears throat, snooty voice] Severe but not unapproachable. Acceptable business attire. [normal voice] Oh, does that sound like a shop pony to you?
:[raccoons chittering]

:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] So sorry for the wait. The shop has some... staffing issues today.
:'''Bracer Britches''': Yes, well, I still haven't had an answer on this thread count.
:'''Fluttershy''': Here at Rarity For You, our merchandise defies typical attempts to quantify its quality, but rest assured, it will make you the envy of all who see it.
:'''Bracer Britches''': Oh, in that case, I'll take three!
:[ka-ching!]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ta-ta!
:[door opens, closes]
:'''Fluttershy''': [normal voice, sighs, faints, pants, sighs] Smoky Jr., I can't believe it worked! [snooty voice] I suppose clothes really do make the pony after all.

:'''Luckette<!--Insufferable Pony 1-->''': I don't know about you, but ''I'' have a full day of shopping planned. And if even one shop pony isn't up to my standards, well, I shall make my displeasure quite plain.
:'''Strawberry Ice<!--Insufferable Pony 2-->''': Oh, you are wicked! [laughing]
:'''Rarity''': Canterlot fashion show or no, I simply can't leave Fluttershy to fend for herself with these Manehattanites. [panting]
:'''Bracer Britches''': Rarity?
:[screech]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, I'm afraid I can't stop. Potential emergency at the boutique.
:'''Bracer Britches''': Oh, well, whatever it is, I'm quite certain the pony you left in charge can handle it. Oh, she's simply divine!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, well, I always knew Fluttershy had it in her. [laughs] And there's still time to catch the train to Canterlot!

:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] It's an unique play on the old standard. We call it a Rarity cut with a triple-cut stitched hem and a guacamole chevka pattern fabric.
:'''Silver Berry''': Don't you mean "chevron"?
:'''Fluttershy''': If I had ''meant'' "chevron", then ''that's'' what I would've said.
:'''Silver Berry''':  [chuckles] Of course. It's so unique! So en vogue! It must be mine!
:[ka-ching!]
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [normal voice] Aw, thanks, everyone. But I feel I should push the snootiness further.
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': If you really ''wanna'' help, I suppose serving tea would be nice. Oh, if you don't mind.

:[tea pouring]
:'''Old Money''': I like my accessories bold and shiny, and I'm just not seeing anything nearly bold and shiny enough.
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] I'm afraid bold and shiny won't work with your whole... ''modelle''. Perhaps... pointy.
:'''Old Money''': Pointy? Yes! I must have pointy!
:'''Fluttershy''': Not everypony can pull off a found object, but you... nearly get there.
:[ka-ching!]
:'''Valley Trend''': [millennial accent] I need, like, a red carpet glitz-and-glamour gown that's also casual, but, like, still artsy and a total head-turner.
:'''Fluttershy''': Yes. Casual chic ''prêt-à-porter'' is very ''branché'' this season.
:'''Valley Trend''': Uhhh... Like, I don't understand any of that, so, like... I don't care about it?
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, one moment, please.
:[zip!]
:[raccoons chitter]
:'''Fluttershy''': [normal voice] Oh, I think I need a new character.

:'''Fluttershy''': [hipster voice] Okay, I've got, like, this high-key savage look for you? It's a totally live ensemble with a little, like, thingies that sparkle and make the whole squad go, "Whoa! That pony is 'woke'!"
:'''Valley Trend''': That is, like, exactly what I need!
:[raccoons chitter]

:'''"Snow Hope"''': This store is a desperate wasteland of nothingness. Do you have anything in black?
:'''Fluttershy''': [hipster voice] Can you, like, chill for one sec? BRB.
:[zip!]

:'''Fluttershy''': [goth voice] It's not like the futility of shopping can be made better with black leather and metal studs, but they help.
:'''"Snow Hope"''': Uh.... that jacket completes me.
:'''Joan Pommelway<!--Posh Customer-->''': [spits] [British accent] This tea's, like, lukewarm. It's barely drinkable.
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] This tea must always be at a precise temperature! See that it doesn't happen again!
:[raccoon chitter sadly]
:'''Fluttershy''': [hipster voice] Whoa, that color is, like, almost too lit for you? [goth voice] The blackness of this vest is a reflection of your soul. [snooty voice] This hemline is nothing short of an inspiration of craftsponyship. Are you sure you deserve it?
:[music]
:[hoof pounding]
:[raccoons chittering]
:[slow motion sounds]
:[splash]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Mare E. Lynn''': [screaming]
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] I don't know what's worse – that you spilled the tea or that it's still cold! Either get it right or go back to the forest!
:[racoons chittering angrily]
:[dishes clatter]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, it is so hard to find good help these days.

:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Spike''': Okay! Okay! Slow down, everyone! I'm doing my best!
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Spike''': So, Rarity is busy at an important fashion show, and Fluttershy is running her shop in Manehattan, but to do it, she's playing different shop pony characters that are all mean?
:[raccoons chittering happily]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How in the world did you figure ''that'' out, Spike?
:'''Spike''': I'm not Dragon Charades champion for nothin'!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't imagine Fluttershy would ''ever'' be mean to her animal friends. This sounds serious. Spike, tell everyone it's time to head back to Saddle Row!
:[raccoons chittering]

:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] I wouldn't think it was possible to make something so dowdy even ''more'' matronly, but here you are. [goth voice] It's like a scream in the void, empty and ultimately meaningless. [hipster voice] I would srsly<!--don't change this, to keep the hipster thing going--> help you right now, but, like, I don't wanna, you know?
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You weren't kidding. This is worse than we thought! She's being horrible to everypony!
:'''Applejack''': Uh, are you sure that's even Fluttershy?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe it's just three really, really fast ponies that really, really look like her!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, let's find out! Hey, Fluttershy? Are you running the shop or performing in a one-pony show?
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] If you don't mind, I can only improve the taste of ''one'' customer at a time. You'll have to wait your turn. Ugh, honestly! These small town ponies come to the big city and think they can behave any way they please!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?! ''You'' are a small-town pony! And your cottage isn't even ''in'' the town!
:'''Applejack''': Look, Fluttershy, we came here because we were worried and we care about you.
:'''Fluttershy''': [goth voice, to Neigh Sayer] Let's get out of this aura of positivity before it consumes us.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': As fun as this Fluttershy switcheroo game is, Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad are really concerned.
:'''Spike''': Yeah! They came all the way to Ponyville to get us.
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [hipster voice] They should have, like, stayed there? The shop is, like, a no-rodent zone now.
:'''Applejack''', '''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Twilight Sparkle''', and '''Spike''': [gasps]
:[raccoons gasping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': She called them "rodents"?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fluttershy, I understand why you think you have to act this way for these customers, but there's gotta be a better way.
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] [sarcastically] Goodness! You are so right. Please, step this way so that we may ''discuss'' your concerns.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I knew you'd come to your senses!
:[door slams]
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] Indeed.

:[crowd muttering]
:'''Rarity''': Ugh, the centerpiece of my collection, and it's ''still'' not right! Oh, darling, I'm afraid we've literally run out of time. It's up to you! Go out there and sell it! Now, attitude!
:[ponies cheering, cameras clicking]

:'''Rarity''': I don't understand. When I left Fluttershy, she had everything well in hoof.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, things might have seemed all right when you left, but they're definitely not all right now.
:'''Applejack''': She's actin' worse than the worst Manehattanite I ever saw!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': She kicked us out of the shop!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': She called Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad... "rodents"!
:'''Rarity''': Wh-wh-wha... ''Rodents''?! Well, why didn't you say that from the start?! She obviously needs help! Come on!

:'''Fluttershy''': [goth voice] Your melancholy is way too shallow for a look with this much unfeeling depth.
:'''"Snow Hope"''': Huh.
:'''Fluttershy''': [hipster voice] Ugh! Your style isn't even on the same page? Turn away. Don't even look at it, okay?
:'''Valley Trend''': [gasps] I can't even!
:[magic noises]
:[hooks sliding]
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] I think not, dear! This is all far too fashion forward for the likes of ''you''!
:'''Bracer Britches''': Ugh! Well, I never!
:[door opens]
:[door slams]
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] Told ya it was bad.
:'''Rarity''': Bad? This is worse than I could've possibly imagined!
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] Rarity! I'm so glad you're here! [kissing noises] Finally, a pony who understands that the couture in this shop is far too brilliant to even consider selling!
:'''Rarity''': Whaaat?!
:'''Fluttershy''': [hipster voice] You, like, totally get how lame customers are? Ugh! [goth voice] Watching them leave filled me with a sweet sadness. [snooty voice] And you'll be pleased to hear that I've taken care of your rodent situation.
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Will somebody tell her to stop saying that?!
:'''Rarity''': That's ''it!'' Fluttershy, I'm afraid you've left me no choice! You are ''terminated!''
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] Well! Good luck replacing ''me''! Humph!
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Well, thankfully I— [shrieks]
:'''Fluttershy''': [goth voice] I always thought she was too controlling.
:'''Rarity''': You— you— you are terminated, too!
:'''Fluttershy''': [goth voice] Whatever.
:'''Rarity''': Now, I— [shrieks]
:'''Fluttershy''': [hipster voice] I know, right? I mean, uh, ugh?
:'''Rarity''': Actually, you're, like, totally terminated as well!
:'''Fluttershy''': [hipster voice] Like, okay.
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Well, I'm glad that's over— [shrieks]
:'''Fluttershy''': [normal voice] I guess I owe everypony an apology.
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] You think?
:'''Fluttershy''': I got so caught up trying to please all of your customers that—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What customers?
:'''Fluttershy''': I might have taken my salespony characters a little too far.
:[pumping]
:'''Fluttershy''': [to raccoons] I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You know I was only pretending, right?
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But, Fluttershy, why did you think you needed to be somepony else to run the shop?
:'''Fluttershy''': I guess acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave me the confidence to interact with them.
:'''Rarity''': Darling, I'd never trust some horrible Saddle Row pony to run my shop. That's why I wanted a friend to do it.
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, I'd definitely rather be myself anyway, even if I don't exactly have what it takes to be a shop pony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I wouldn't sell yourself short. Those salespony characters all came from you!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! I think you totally have what it takes.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe a little ''too'' much.
:'''Rarity''': Indeed. You have all the inner strength you need, but I think we prefer it coming from our sweet, regular Fluttershy.
:'''Applejack''', '''Pinkie Pie''', '''Rainbow Dash''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughing]
:'''Rarity''': And that's just given me the inspiration I'm looking for!

:'''Rarity''': And last one... There! The missing piece for my new collection – the Warrior of Inner Strength!
:[mane cast and ponies cheering and applauding]
:[raccoons chittering]
:'''Pony''': Oh, gorgeous!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, it's lovely, Rarity! I'm just sorry you had to leave the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show early.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, darling, making the perfect dress is scads more satisfying than showing it off.
:[customers chattering]
:'''Blueberry Curls''': Ooh, striking dress, Rarity. I certainly hope you aren't trying to undercut the Royal Fashion Show by ducking out and debuting it here.
:'''Rarity''': What? No, I—
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] Have ''you'' considered the possibility that the Royal Fashion Show is trying to undercut Rarity's by continuing on in Canterlot and not moving the whole affair here?! Hmm?! Have you?! Hmmm?!
:'''Blueberry Curls''': I, uh... No.
:'''Fluttershy''': [snooty voice] Hmph! Just as I thought! Hmmm!
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': [to Rarity] Oh! [giggles] Inner strength.
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Rarity''': [laughing]

:'''Soarin''': I'm sooo glad I made it to Las Pegasus before the fastest, most thrilling ride of all time closes for good!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait. The fastest, most thrilling ride of all time?
:'''Misty Fly''': [gasps] She hasn't heard of the Wild Blue Yonder?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Of course I have! It's that one where, uh... All right, you got me. What is it?
:'''Soarin''': Only the coolest rollercoaster ever!
:'''Misty Fly''': [scoffs] You can't really call yourself a Wonderbolt if you haven't been on it.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It looks incredible!
:'''Soarin''': Oh, it is. First, you strap yourself into the cloud rocket car, and then you're catapulted straight through a...

:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...series of daring dips and terrifying turns...

:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...flipping upside-down so many times you don't know which way is up!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': 'Til finally you climb to the highest peak on the rails! Then drop towards the ground at lightning speed...

:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...before coming up to a screeching halt! It's the coolest ride ever to exist in the history of Equestria!
:'''Applejack''': So, ''when'' did you ride it?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh. [laughs] I haven't.
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Applejack''': [grunts]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The ride closes this week! Forever! But I can't go to Las Pegasus because I have to teach at Twilight's school. I'm gonna miss out on the coolest rollercoaster of ''all time''! Unless...
:'''Applejack''': Why do I feel like you're about to ask me a mighty big favor?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Can you cover my classes? [whimper]
:'''Applejack''': Absolutely!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Really? Awesome! [whoosh, grunts]
:'''Applejack''': On one condition. You tag along with a few other ponies goin' to Las Pegasus.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Surely you don't mean Granny Smith!
:'''Applejack''': No, no, of course not. I mean Granny Smith and the ''rest'' of the Gold Horseshoe Gals.
:'''Granny Smith''': Hurry your haunches, hinnies!
:'''Applejack''': Grand Auntie Applesauce, cousin Apple Rose, and cousin Goldie Delicious.
:[cat meows]
:'''Applejack''': Why, I'm sure they'd be plumb tickled to have you join their annual grandmares' trip to Las Pegasus. It'll be perfect. I'll teach your classes, and you can look after them for me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Look ''after'' them?
:'''Applejack''': So they don't get too carried away. Usually Big Mac goes along as a chaperone, but I'm sure he'd love a break.
:[drag, snap, meow]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': There is no way I'm going to Las Pegasus with a bunch of old, slow grannies!
:'''Applejack''': So you don't mind missin' your ''only'' chance to ride the Wild Blue Yonder?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh, fine! I'll go!
:'''Applejack''': Ha! That's the spirit! Now skedaddle so I can help them get ready.
:'''Granny Smith''': Applejack! Have you seen my cranky flank cream? I can't find it in this whole tootin' farmhouse.
:'''Applejack''': It's, uh, gonna take a while.

:[clock chimes]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groaning] Why is this taking so long? The Wild Blue Yonder's gonna close before we even get to Las Pegasus.
:'''Applejack''': Here. I made a list to help you keep the grandmares out of trouble. Don't wanna have to bring 'em back home before you get to go on your rollercoaster.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That could happen?!
:'''Applejack''': Only if you don't follow the rules. These grannies need a lot of care. If one of 'em overdoes it, it's bye-bye Las Pegasus for the lot of ya.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [reading] "Make sure they get their naps". "Eat only soft foods". "Careful when dancing"? "Don't get too excited"? Seriously?!
:'''Applejack''': And ''don't'' let 'em out of your sight. ''Ever''.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait. Then how am I supposed to go on the rollercoaster?
:'''Applejack''': You'll find time. And you might even learn a thing or two about havin' a good time from these old gals.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. That'll happen.
:'''Applejack''': All right, y'all! Time to get this show on the road! [chuckles] Or in the sky, in this case.
:[grannies chattering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] Come on, come on, come on!
:[cats meowing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]
:[whooshing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Go, go, go, go, go!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Argh! Everypony okay in there?
:'''Granny Smith''': Dandy as a pansy in a plant pot!
:'''Apple Rose''': You know, this hot air balloon ride reminds me of the time I climbed a tree. Have I ever told you that story?
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': Only about a million times.
:'''Apple Rose''': Huh? What did you say?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [echoing] They said they've heard the tree story!
:'''Apple Rose''': Oh, you wanna hear the tree story? Okay.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Here we go again.
:'''Apple Rose''': Back when I was a young filly, I was afraid of tree-climbin'. These knockin' hooves sweatin'. Have you ever had the hoof sweats? Well, they're just the worst thing. You know, cousin Strudel – she used to get 'em too. Now, of course she was a champion fritter... [fades out]

:[distant cheers]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The Wild Blue Yonder is in our hotel?! Uh, I bet you grannies are feeling super tired from your journey.
:'''Granny Smith''': Nope! How about a trot down the avenue to see the sights, girls?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Oh, forget the sights! I came here to play some serious horseshoe toss!
:'''Apple Rose''': Oh, can we see the rainbow fountains at the water show? They're so magical!
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': My pores are crying for a mud mask at the Prism Palace Spa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You know what would be really fun? Relaxing in our room! Come on. Last one to the hotel is a rotten apple! [whoosh] Let me get that for ya. [grunting]

:[distant cheering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! There it is! The best rollercoaster ever!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Aaah! Warm up those withers, ladies! There's a horseshoe-hurlin' trophy with our names on it!
:'''Grannies''': [groaning]
:'''Applejack vision''': [ghostly voice] ''Don't let them get too excited! Or you'll have to go hooooooome!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. That sounds a little ''too'' exciting. Why don't we get you checked in first?
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': Oh, my. You are a strong pony. Aren't you, sugarhocks?
:'''"Luggage Cart"''': [gulps]
:'''Grannies''': [giggling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans]

:[door opens]
:'''"Luggage Cart"''': Welcome to our Gold Horseshoe Suite. Only the best of the best for our favorite guests. Which, of course, means you lovely mares.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': Why, thank you a bushel and a peck, you scrumptious morsel of frosted carrot cake.
:'''"Luggage Cart"''': Oh. [chuckles] Thank ''you'', ma'am.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': I think he was sweet on me. Maybe I should ask him to accompany me to the magic show tonight.
:'''Granny Smith''': Ha-ha! You sure your name's not Applesaucey? Better find the brakes on that buggy, sugar. We just got here.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': You're right. Better see what else is out there first. The day is young, and I am not!
:'''Grannies''': [giggling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, Granny Smith's right. Let's not overdo it. How about a nice nap so you can really enjoy Las Pegasus?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': [yawns] Good idea. We could use some shut-eye, hmm?
:'''Apple Rose''': But I'm not tired. Uh, oh, right! Uh, yaaaawn.
:'''Grannies''': [yawning]
:'''Granny Smith''': You go along now and explore while we rest, sugar booger. Yawn.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, if you say so! [to Lemon Squeezy] What? They'll be in here sleeping the whole time I'm gone!
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Quit judging me!
:[door closes]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [clears throat] One ticket for the coolest rollercoaster of all time, please. [gasps] But... But... this line never ends!
:'''"Cranberry Muffin"''': I know, right? Good thing we can just stand here all day without any responsibilities waiting for us!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groan]
:'''"Cranberry Muffin"''': Oh, hey, thanks!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Enjoy the ride.

:[door opens, closes]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heh. They didn't even know I left.
:[cat meows]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa!
:[cat meows]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aah! [gasps] They're gone!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [panicked whimpering] Granny Smith! Apple Rose! Are you here?! Applesauce? Goldie? Oh, I'm the worst chaperone ever!
:'''Applejack vision''': [ghostly voice] ''Don't let them out of your siiiiiiiiight!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know, I know! Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a group of old mares around here?
:'''"Tight End"''': Lady, you just described half the ponies in this place.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] This place is huge! They could be anywhere!
:'''Crowd''': [chanting] Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie!
:'''Carnival Barker''': Can they do it? Can good old Goldie Delicious and the Gold Horseshoe Gals break the all-time resort record, folks?
:[clang]
:'''Crowd''': [cheers]
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Now that's how you hurl a horseshoe!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ha! No way! Goldie's totally got game!
:'''Carnival Barker''': Make some noise for the best-played game of horseshoes this resort has ever seen! Can you believe your eyes, folks?
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! Go, Goldie!
:'''Carnival Barker''': Stand back! She's getting excited!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh? Uh-oh!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Oh, oop!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, mind if I try?
:[clank]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoops. Guess I'm no good at this game. Sorry.
:'''Carnival Barker''': And the Gold Horseshoe Gals are out! Looks like the show's over, everypony.
:'''Crowd''': Awww! [groaning]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, I'm so glad I found you! Everypony feeling okay? Not too excited?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Pretty much the opposite right now.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] Good. From now on, I'm not letting you grannies out of my sight.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': In that case, let's paint the town candy apple red!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Ooh! We could play more games!
:'''Apple Rose''': Or go shopping for hats! Have I ever told you about the time I got a new hat, and it turned out to be a bird? [laughs]
:'''Granny Smith''': ''That's'' what we ought to do!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Really?
:'''Granny Smith''': Hit the buffet! All that horseshoe tossin' sure works up an appy-tite.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] Uh-huh...

:'''Granny Smith''': I love me some nachos. I'mma set my dentures loose on these vittles until the crumbs cry uncle!
:'''Applejack vision''': [ghostly voice] ''They can only eat soft foods! You're a nacho away from no rolly-coaster!''
:[whoosh, clang]
:'''Granny Smith''': [exclamation of surprise]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Granny. You know you can't have those. They're super crunchy.
:[clang]
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How about some nice soft carrot soup, instead?
:'''Granny Smith''': I thought you was supposed to be the fun one.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait. I ''am'' fun!
:'''Carnival Barker''': [over P.A.] Attention all, thrill-seekers! There's only one day left to ride the ride of all rides, the Wild Blue Yonder, before it's gone for good! Get in line! Now!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [anxious groan] So... what does everypony want to do tonight? I was thinking go to our room and put on eye masks and earplugs? [crunching]
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': I'd rather hit the club and show off my dance moves. I'm quite a legend when it comes to rumba.
:'''Grannies''': [agreement]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sounds kind of intense. Aren't you all exhausted from your big day?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Heck no! We save up our energy all year for Las Pegasus weekend, isn't that right, girls?
:'''Auntie Applesauce''', '''Apple Rose''', and '''Granny Smith''': Mmm-hmm!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh. Dancing it is, then. I'll be there.
:[splat]

:[trance-like music]
:'''Applejack vision''': [ghostly voice] ''Careful when daaaaaanciiiiing!''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh! Stop doing that! Uh, that's probably enough dancing for now! Right, Apple Rose?
:'''Apple Rose''': Oh, that was just my warm-up.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': Look! It's our favorite magicians, Big Bucks and Jack Pot! And aren't they lookin' handsome as ever?
:'''Jack Pot''': [laughs, ahem] You little fillies have got some smooth moves!
:'''Grannies''': [giggling]
:'''Big Bucks''': Say, how would you Gold Horseshoe Gals like to bring some of that good energy into our magic show tonight?
:'''Jack Pot''': Here's five complimentary VIP tickets to our most amazing trick in the Pon{{H:title|é|e}} Fantastique Theater, just over there.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': Sugarcube, we never miss your show.
:'''Jack Pot''': Fabulous. We'll save a spot for you on stage.
:'''Big Bucks''': And in our hearts.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So gross.
:'''Grannies''': [cheering]
:'''Granny Smith''': Yeehaw, girls! Applesauce landed us some Very Important Pony tickets for the show tonight! [chuckles]
:'''Grannies''': [laughing and giggling]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, come on! You said you were going back to the room after dancing! So each pony could have some alone time?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Oh, now don't be a stick in the mud! Trust me, you'll loooove this show! It's the best thing in Las Pegasus!
:[grannies cheering]
:'''"Cranberry Muffin"''': Oh, hey! Thanks for giving me your place in line. They said I'm one of the last ponies ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! Ha!

:[applause]
:'''Big Bucks''': And now, for the trick that made us famous!
:'''Jack Pot''': The most dangerous magical feat known to ponykind.
:[music]
:'''Jack Pot''': We'd like to invite some ''very'' special mares to the stage.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': That's our cue, girls!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, where are you going? Come back!
:'''Big Bucks''': Meet our lovely assistants!
:[applause]
:'''Jack Pot''': They will make a splashtastic escape using only the instructions we give them... with our minds.
:'''Crowd''': [oohs]
:'''Big Bucks''': Don't try this at home, folks!
:[hatch opens, water flowing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]
:'''Applejack vision''': [normal voice] ''Do I really have to say anything?''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Release those grannies, right now!
:'''Crowd''': [shocked gasps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:[creaking]
:[splash!]
:'''Crowd''': [gasps]
:'''Granny Smith''': What'd ya go and do that for?! That was our big star moment!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Y-You were in danger! I saw the water! You were trapped!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Oh, pish-tosh! This is a ''magic'' show! We've seen it a thousand times! Everypony always escapes.
:[crowd murmuring]
:'''Big Bucks''': Uh, that's right, folks! Because of our, um, skill as magicians!
:'''Jack Pot''': And now, a disappearing act!
:[poof!]
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': Well, I hope you're happy! We've been waiting to be picked as the lovely assistants in that trick for years!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': You keep ruinin' our fun! I had a hot hoof goin' in that game you decided to lose for us!
:'''Granny Smith''': And I ''wanted'' to eat those nachos at the buffet!
:'''Apple Rose''': And I could have torn up the dance floor if you didn't keep stopping me!
:'''Granny Smith''': They're bein' too polite to say it, so I will! Rainbow Dash, we thought you'd be a hoot, but I ain't never met a wetter hen!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?!
:'''Goldie Delicious''': She's right! You've had your mane in a twist ever since we arrived!
:'''Apple Rose''': Is something the matter, dear?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm so sorry, everypony. The truth is, all I wanted to do for this whole trip is ride the Wild Blue Yonder. I mean, it's why I came to Las Pegasus in the first place! Applejack told me not to let you out of my sight, or you might overdo it and we'd have to go home early.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': Applejack put you up to this?
:'''Grannies''': [annoyed chattering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, now it's too late. I ruined your trip, ''and'' it's the last day ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! The line is so long, I'll never get to go on it.
:'''Grannies''': [laughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, what's so funny?
:'''Granny Smith''': [chuckling] Is that all you wanted?
:'''Goldie Delicious''': Well, fish-flavored kitten kibble. Why didn't you say so sooner? Come on, girls!

:[trumpet fanfare]
:'''Granny Smith''': We're Gold Horseshoe members. The most exclusive club in Las Pegasus. And she's with us.
:'''Goldie Delicious''': We've been comin' here every moon since we can remember. Even some we ''don't'' remember.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': It definitely has its perks.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Like fancy suites and rollercoaster rides?
:'''Apple Rose''': That's right. And I hope you like riding in the front.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um, yes! [squeals] This is amazing! Isn't this amazing?
:'''Granny Smith''': Sugar, you probably want to hold on 'bout now.
:[coaster clanking]
:[cheering]
:[snap! snap! snap!]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm sorry I misjudged you for being older ponies. You mares are actually pretty cool.
:'''Granny Smith''': Rainbow Dash?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, Granny?
:'''Granny Smith''': The gals and I have been talkin', and, well... We think you're a hoot after all! We'd like to invite you to become a permanent member of the Gold Horseshoe Gals! [hoots]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ha-ha! Really?
:'''Grannies''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Auntie Applesauce''': Same time next year?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I wouldn't miss it for anything!

:[doors open]
:'''Scootaloo''': Princess Twilight!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': We're glowing!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggling] That's what happens when you're summoned by the Map.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Somepony needs ''our'' help?
:'''Apple Bloom''': ''We're'' being called by the Map?
:'''Scootaloo''': Did I mention we're glowing?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggling]
:'''Scootaloo''': So where exactly in Equestria are we needed?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, where you're going isn't even ''in'' Equestria.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Wow! That's almost... off the table!
:'''Apple Bloom''': But what's way out there?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mount Aris, the home of the Hippogriffs! And that's where you're headed!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Whoa...!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You really don't need to come with us, Twilight. We can take care of this mission just fine on our own.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah!
:[thud]
:'''Scootaloo''': Oof!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Ugh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know that. But I'm not so sure the ponies who care about you want you going off so far on your own. Besides, there's some school business I need to take care of on Mount Aris. This permission slip is for Silverstream. It's very important that her mother and father sign it, or else no field trips.
:'''Scootaloo''': [whispering, to Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle] Sounds like somepony just wants a vacation.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [giggling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, yes, I have been wanting to visit Mount Aris ever since the Hippogriffs moved back. But it's purely research. Silverstream's brother is gonna meet us there and take us to their houses.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Wow! They have more than one house?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I guess so. The social structure of the Hippogriffs and seaponies is a bit of a mystery.
:'''"All Aboard"''': All aboard! Last stop – the new Mount Aris Station!
:[ponies chattering]
:[train whistle blows]
:[train chugging]

:'''Sweetie Belle''': I don't know if I'd like being a Hippogriff. Part bird, part pony...
:'''Scootaloo''': I'm happy with just my pony parts, thanks.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I think Hippogriffs ''are'' pretty neat. I learned all about them from Applejack. The Hippogriffs all once lived happily on Mount Aris. But when the Storm King invaded, they used a magic pearl to turn into seaponies and escape to the underwater safety of Seaquestria. Then, in the Battle of Canterlot, when Applejack defeated the Storm King—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait, what? She told you ''she'' defeated him? By herself?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Uh, maybe she didn't say that exactly. But it makes for a better story.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggling]
:[train whistle blows]
:'''"All Aboard"''': Final stop – Mount Aris Station!
:'''Scootaloo''': [gasps]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Whoa!
:[train chugging]
:[brakes hissing]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': All right. So what kind of cutie mark-related friendship problem do you think we're supposed to solve.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know. But Hippogriffs don't have cutie marks. So it might not have anything to do with that at all.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Huh. Still, the Map called us, so it must be a kind of problem that only we can solve.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Go, Crusaders!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': But how do we know exactly who we're supposed to help?
:'''Scootaloo''': Ahem. Attention, please! Anygriff here have a problem?
:[beat]
:'''Scootaloo''': Eh. That's all I got.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Maybe if the Map could be a little more specific about our mission, like maybe... an address?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Map doesn't really work like that. But I'm sure you and whoever needs help will find each other.

:[water splashing]
:'''Terramar''': Excuse me! Miss Sparkle? Over here! Sorry I'm late. I'm Silverstream's brother Terramar.
:'''Apple Bloom''': A Hippogriff can have a seapony for a brother? How does that work exactly?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Shhh! It's rude to ask a question like that!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Scootaloo''': Whoa!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Can I ask now?
:'''Terramar''': [chuckles] It is kind of strange. See, after the Storm King was defeated, the seaponies didn't have to hide anymore. So some of them changed back to Hippogriffs and went home to Mount Aris.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But others got used to living under the water and stayed in Seaquestria.
:'''Terramar''': And me? Well, I kind of go back and forth with this. It's a tiny piece of the magic pearl. It was split up among our kingdoms.
{|
|
:'''Apple Bloom''': Whoa!
|
:'''Sweetie Belle''' and '''Scootaloo''': Cool!
|}
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'm pretty eager to see the Hippogriff village. You know, to... get this form signed. And... research! So...
:'''Apple Bloom''': Hey, Terramar? Does anygriff you know up there have a problem they need help with?
:'''Terramar''': [chuckles] On Mount Aris? No. Everygriff is pretty happy up there. [sighs] It's a great place to live.

:[Hippogriffs laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoa! This looks amazing! Last time I was here, it was a ghost town!
:'''Terramar''': Yeah. Queen Novo thought it was important to return our village to its former glory.
:[trumpet fanfare]
:'''Sky Beak''': And now, I officially open the "Glad to Be a Hippogriff" Festival!
:[trumpet fanfare]
:[Hippogriffs cheering]
:[whoosh!]
:[Hippogriffs cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Ahh! Whoa!
:[Hippogriffs continue cheering]
:'''Scootaloo''': Wow! We picked a good day to show up!
:'''Terramar''': Not really. We do this every weekend. Hippogriffs ''really'' like being Hippogriffs.
:[Hippogriffs cheering]
:'''Sky Beak''': [chuckles] There's my boy!
:'''Terramar''': Hi, Dad!
:'''Sky Beak''': Haven't seen you in days, son. Wish you'd come around more often.
:'''Terramar''': Oh! Dad, these are some of Silverstream's friends from Equestria. They came up to—
:'''Sky Beak''': [gasps] Princess Twilight Sparkle! [screeches]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Aah!
:'''Sky Beak''': Attention, everygriff! Princess Twilight Sparkle is here! She's Silverstream's teacher!
:[Hippogriffs gaspinng and exclaiming]
:'''Sky Beak''': Here to take in the marvel that is Mount Aris, your Highness?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Absolutely! ''And'' to have you sign a form for Silverstream.
:'''Sky Beak''': Glad to! But first, let's show the princess some real Mount Aris hospitality! To the refreshment tent for a stein of salmon juice!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Eh. Research. See you later! And good luck! I know you'll find your mission!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, your dad's certainly... outgoing, isn't he?
:'''Terramar''': He's a great guy. All my relatives are nice. That's kind of the problem—
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Wait, stop.
:[whimsical wind chimes]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': What's that wonderful sound?
:'''Terramar''': Those are the Harmonizing Heights. Legend says that—
:[zoom!]
:[whimsical wind chimes]
:[birds chirping]
:[water splashing]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Woo-hoo! Yeah! Awesome! I love this!
:'''Terramar''': Uh, is she okay?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': This is absolutely the best place ever! You are so lucky!
:'''Scootaloo''': And you get to swim in the ocean! You have two great places to live!
:'''Apple Bloom''': How do you make up your mind which one to stay in?
:'''Terramar''': I can't. That's the problem.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Did you say... "problem"?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': ''You'' have a problem?!
:'''Scootaloo''': Yes!

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Woo-hoo! We discovered our mission!
:'''Scootaloo''': All right!
:'''Apple Bloom''': We did it!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [chuckles nervously]
:'''Scootaloo''': Sorry. You were talking about your problem?
:'''Terramar''': Right. Like I said, Mount Aris is one great place to live. That's why Silverstream and my dad and some of my cousins came back here. But Seaquestria is another great place to live. That's where my mom is.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Ohhhh. I-I didn't know that.
:'''Terramar''': So no matter where I am, I feel like I'm letting someone down.
:'''Apple Bloom''': No wonder you're having such a hard time deciding.
:'''Terramar''': And I have to choose soon. Every other griff my age already knows where they belong. I'm still not sure.
:'''Scootaloo''': When in doubt, chart it out!

:'''Scootaloo''': Now, we put down everything great about each place and everything not so great. Compare them, and... your decision is made for you!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, it's obvious, isn't it? Mount Aris is the best of all possible worlds. Pro – it's beautiful. Con – too far from Equestria. I think that pretty much sums it up.
:'''Terramar''': But you haven't been to Seaquestria yet. How can you even compare them?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Terramar's right, Sweetie Belle. It'd be fair if we visited both places before we decide.
:[screech]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, everypony! This festival is fantastic! Look what I won at the ring toss booth! Ahem. But of course, I'm really here on business. Sky Beak's already signed the form. Now I just need your mom's signature. Is she around?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Um... she's a seapony. In Seaquestria.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''That's'' what Silverstream meant by "houses"!
:'''Terramar''': Mm-hmm. If you'd like to meet my mom, we're just heading down there now.
:'''Apple Bloom''': And how exactly are we gonna visit underwater?

:[magic sounds]
:[water bubbling]
:'''Scootaloo''': Whoa! [giggling] Woo-hoo! Yeah! [giggling] Whoa! This must be just like flying! Woo-hoo!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Where's your mom's house, Terramar?
:'''Terramar''': Come on. It's this way.
:'''Scootaloo''': This is awesome!

:'''Scootaloo''': [giggling]
:'''Terramar''': Mom!
:'''Ocean Flow''': Terramar! Welcome home, baby! No excuses. This time, you're staying for dinner.
:'''Terramar''': [chuckles] Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, this is my mom Ocean Flow. And this is—
:'''Ocean Flow''': [gasps] Princess Twilight Sparkle! What an honor! You know, Silverstream just raves about you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, she is one of our most hardworking students. In fact, I brought this form for you to sign so that—
:'''Ocean Flow''': Both my children are so smart. Would you like to see their baby pictures?
:'''Terramar''': ''Mom!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That sounds adorable! I'd love to! And you know, to find out about aquatic pony early development and, uh...
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [giggling] Research.
:'''Ocean Flow''': Oh, well, maybe your friends would like a snack while we're gone? Some kelp chips? Fish oil tea?
:'''Terramar''': No, thanks, Mom. I'm gonna go show them around.

:'''Scootaloo''': Look out! [giggling] Can't catch me!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Huh. Not much sunlight down here, is there?
:'''Scootaloo''': [giggling]

:[bongo drums drumming]
:'''Scootaloo''': Boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom!

:'''Sweetie Belle''': No grass to run in and no hooves to run on it with. And excuse me, but how do you keep from getting all pruney? [sighs]

:'''Scootaloo''': [laughing]
:[thud]
:'''Scootaloo''': [bubbly] Everything sounds funny down here!

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Okay. I've seen everything I need to. So, uh, why don't we find Twilight Sparkle, finish the chart, and, uh, head back up the mountain? I have some serious field twirling to do.
:'''Scootaloo''': Where's she going? I want to stay and swim some more! [sighs]

:[magic sounds]
:[seagull squawking]
:'''Sky Beak''': [screeches] Princess Twilight, you're back! And just in time for the screeching competition.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Why not? Could be another trophy in my future! Be back soon!
:'''Scootaloo''': All right! Let's add some positives to the Seaquestria side!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Uh-huh!
:'''Scootaloo''': Swimming is like flying, multi-color fish, and did I mention the flying thing?!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': You forgot the cons. Dark, wet, sea monsters...
:'''Scootaloo''': I don't remember any sea monsters. Apple Bloom, looks like it's up to you.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Me? Well... Both places have a lot of good things about them. I can understand why it's hard for you to decide.
{{#lst:Your Heart Is in Two Places|song}}
:'''Apple Bloom''': Terramar, where're you goin'?
:'''Terramar''': Ugh! If you all can't even agree amongst yourselves, how am I supposed to make up ''my'' mind?! It's hopeless!

:'''Scootaloo''': Hmph!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Sweetie Belle said to tell you it's your fault that Terramar ran off.
:'''Scootaloo''': Well, you tell Sweetie Belle that if it weren't for her, our mission would've been over by now! ''And'' a success!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [sighs] Scootaloo says this whole thing is your fault.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Well, tell ''her'' that ''I'm'' not the one who dashed all of Terramar's hopes and made him give up on the world! ''Both'' worlds!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [sighs] Sweetie Belle says it's your fault that Terramar ran— Oh. Wait. I already told you that, didn't I?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, what's going on? Where's Terramar?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Uh, well... he... he kinda left. He wanted to be by himself.
:'''Scootaloo''': Which was not my fault!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Mine, either!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, of course not. Why would you think that?
:'''Scootaloo''' and '''Sweetie Belle''': Because it ''was'' our fault.
:'''Scootaloo''': All we had to do was help him choose which world to live in.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': And we let him down.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Whoever said that he ''had'' to choose?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, he did.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm... Maybe Terramar's making it harder than it has to be.
:'''Ocean Flow''': Yoo-hoo! Princess! We're having a seashell-crafting circle. Care to join us?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, we're right in the middle of—
:'''Sky Beak''': There you are! The flag-folding ceremony's about to begin!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you, really. I've had a great time in both places today, but... [whispering, to Cutie Mark Crusaders] Wow. This must be how Terramar feels all the time.
:'''Ocean Flow''': Oh! Hello, Sky Beak.
:'''Sky Beak''': Ocean Flow! You're looking well.
:[Hippogriffs and seaponies chattering]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Hmmm... This gives me an idea.

:[water flowing]
:'''Scootaloo''': Huh. I thought for sure he came this way.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [gasps] He did.
:'''Terramar''': And I'm staying here, too! That way, I don't have to be on land or in the water!
:'''Scootaloo''': We're sorry. We were supposed to help you, and...
:'''Sweetie Belle''': ...we just ended up confusing you more. It's all our fault.
:'''Terramar''': Oh, great! ''You're'' sorry, and I'm still confused! I'm staying in my tree.
:'''Apple Bloom''': We might have somethin' worth comin' down for.

:'''Sweetie Belle''': We thought we'd get every creature together for a picnic on the beach.
:'''Scootaloo''': And we mean ''every'' creature!
:[Hippogriffs and seaponies chattering]
:[splashing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughing]
:'''Sky Beak''': Son! There you are! Your friends told us how you've been feeling.
:'''Ocean Flow''': And we're sorry if we ever made you think you had to choose between worlds. That wasn't our intention, honey.
:'''Sky Beak''': Your Hippogriff heritage is something to be proud of, certainly.
:'''Ocean Flow''': But you're more than just where you're from or who you live with. We love you because you're you, no matter where you choose to be.
:'''Sky Beak''': You don't have to decide. You can keep doing what you've been doing – going back and forth.
:'''Ocean Flow''': And enjoying ''both'' places.
:'''Terramar''': [laughing]
:'''Scootaloo''': Something we forgot to add that both places have – family and friends who love you.
:'''Terramar''': Thanks for everything. Hey, uh, are you glowing?
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Yes! We did it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Congratulations! Your first map mission is a success!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Guess that means we're officially done here. I hope you come visit your sister in Equestria.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Yeah, come see us! You'll love it!
:'''Scootaloo''': Who knows? You might even want to live there!
:[beat]
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah, that was a joke.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Princess Celestia, I have an idea for your ones-versary.
:'''Princess Celestia''': My... "ones-versary"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The one-thousand, one-hundred, eleventh year anniversary of when you first raised the sun.
:'''Spike''': Good thing Pinkie Pie reminded us, or we would have forgot to celebrate.
:'''Princess Celestia''': You're not the ''only'' ones. What did you have in mind?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': To commemorate your first sunrise, I've written a play. We'd like to perform it at my School of Friendship, if you don't mind.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [giggling happily] Mind? Oh! Of course not! Oh! I think a play is a fantastic idea!
:'''Spike''': Did she just... prance?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, uh, forgive me for getting so excited. It's just, when I was a filly, my friends often put on plays. [sighs] It was so wonderful. Everypony coming together to create a magical experience to share with others. I've always believed theater brings out the best in us and forges a special bond of friendship.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] I didn't know you used to act!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, not me. I was always too busy with my magic lessons to be part of any plays myself. But still, it's something I always wished I could experience.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And you still can! Princess Celestia, we would be honored if you would be the star of our play!
:'''Spike''': We ''would''?!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Princess Celestia''': You want me to star in your play?!
:'''Spike''': Yeah... When did that happen, exactly?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If you'll excuse us for a second... [whispering] Don't you see, Spike? It's perfect! Princess Celestia has always wanted to be in a play, and this one's about ''her''!
:'''Spike''': [whispering] I guess, but how are we supposed to give her directions? She's the ruler of Equestria!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering] She's also our friend. Celestia's always kind to everypony. So if we have a chance to finally do something for her, we should.
:'''Spike''': Hmmm...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering] Come on. How many times has Celestia helped us? Guided us? Been a warm, calming voice over our shoulder?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': Aah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, Princess Celestia?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Your invitation is very kind, but are you certain it's wise? I have no acting experience at all.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Experience? Pssh! You'll be playing yourself. And we'll all help you. Please? It'd mean so much to the students if you were in our show.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Well, if you're sure...
:'''Spike''': Yeah, what she said.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Then I would be delighted to join your theater troupe!

:[squeak]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Woo-hoo! Confetti is ready! Woo-hoo!
:'''Applejack''': Puh! Wormy apple cores, Pinkie! How many times have I told you to keep your special effects away from my sets?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Three hundred twenty-seven. Oh! Unless you just did. Then it's three hundred twenty-eight. [squee]
:'''Applejack''': Ugh.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I can't believe you've memorized your lines already, Fluttershy.
:'''Fluttershy''': Once you get past terrifying, paralyzing stage fright, the rest is easy. Now I just hope Princess Celestia says we can do our play.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, as soon as she sees these fabulous costumes, all she'll be able to say is "Brava!"
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Heads up! Here comes our answer!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting] Wonderful news, everypony!
:'''Applejack''': Yeehaw! We get to put on our show?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Even better. Princess Celestia is gonna be our star!
:'''Applejack''', '''Rarity''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Starlight Glimmer''', and '''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Spike''': Yeah, that's how I felt, too.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Celestia? Starring in our play? This is huge!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, she was a little nervous at first, but I told her not to worry. With us helping, it will all go smooth as—
:'''Rarity''': Silk! I must find the silk! If Celestia's going to be in our play, we have to take everything up to the next level! None of these old ideas will do!
:[squeak]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah! Forget my regular party cannon! For princess-sized effects, we're gonna need Big Bertha!
:'''Applejack''': Grrrr...! Pinkie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': What?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Our play is gonna be amazing! I gotta tell everypony I know! And even the ones I don't!
:[whoosh, boom!]
:'''Applejack''': Why in tarnation are y'all gettin' so starstruck? We've met Princess Celestia before. Plenty of times.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Those were formal things – galas, world-saving. This is different! Imagine doing sweaty warm-ups with a princess, blowing your nose in front of a princess, sitting around just... talking with a princess.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm a princess. You talk to me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's different. You're not a "princess" princess.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, thanks. Celestia wants to experience the special friendship that theater ponies have. To give her that, you just need to be yourselves.
:'''Fluttershy''': You... You really think so?
:'''Applejack''': Heh. Aw, quit frettin'. It's only a couple o' pals gettin' together to put on a ones-versary play. What could go wrong?

:'''Spike''': [amplified] Places, everypony! We're here to rehearse "A New Day in Equestria"!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [clears throat]
:'''Spike''': [amplified] Directed, written, and produced by Twilight Sparkle.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Page one, act one, scene one. Action!
:[curtains squeaking]
:'''Fluttershy''': Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard, it took five great sorcerers ''plus'' Star Swirl the Bearded to do it.
:'''Young Six''': [straining]
:[clanking]
:'''Fluttershy''': And every day, the unicorns helping Star Swirl would use so much magic, they lost their powers forever. Things looked bleak. Soon, Equestria would lose all its magic users! Then, the land would be covered in darkness for eternity!
:[clanking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [to Spike] Even I can't believe how good my play is! The sets, the props, the outfits – they're all great!
:'''Spike''': And... here comes the best part.
:'''Fluttershy''': But then, a student named Celestia discovered she had the power to raise the sun herself without draining her magic!
:[birds chirping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um, that's your cue, Celestia.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh! Uh, right! Of course! Heh. [clears throat] [quietly] It is time for a new day in Equestria.
:'''Spike''': Um, what?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, uh, I said [quietly] it is time for a new day in Equestria.
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And your delivery was... great! But maybe you should try it a tiny bit louder for the ponies in the back row.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, yes, yes. My Royal Canterlot Voice. Thank you for the reminder, Twilight. [booming] ''It is time for a new day in Equestria!''
:[birds squawking]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh! Goodness! This theater does have strong acoustics. M-My apologies. I'm still learning to hone my craft.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, no! You're doing... fine! Why don't we try it one more time? Just like you're talking to me.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [flat and stilted] It is time for a new day in Equestria-aaa.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A bit more energy.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [rushed and hyperactive] It's time for a new day in Equestria! [normal] Uh, how was that?
:'''Applejack''': Uh, honestly?
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Applejack''': [muffled]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great! Wow! It's hard to believe you've never done this before! Let's move onto the dance number!

:[dance music]
:'''Spike''': Again! Step, buck, leap, touch! Again! Step, buck, leap, touch! Got it? Movin' on! Five, six, seven, eight!
:'''Princess Celestia''': [with wildly varying tone] Come on, Star Swirl. Throw off that must-Y hat and let's have a... a dance!
:[clanking]
:'''Young Six''': [yelps]
:[crash!]
:'''Young Six''': [groaning]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Oh, dear. I think we have a problem!
:'''Applejack''': [whispering] Yeah. Our lead actress is a disaster!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [hyperventilating] What are we gonna do?! If I tell Celestia she's terrible, it'll hurt her feelings, and I'll be a bad friend. But if I keep her in the show, she'll be the laughingstock of Equestria, and I'll be a ''worse'' friend.
:'''Applejack''': Ya need to tell Celestia the truth, Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Any other suggestions?
:'''Spike''': Why don't we just cancel the show?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Real'' suggestions?
:'''Spike''': No, think about it. Right now, most of Equestria doesn't even know we're doing a ones-versary play. If we shut it down...
:'''Rarity''': ...Nopony will ever miss it!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So they'll never find out Princess Celestia's a bad actress!
:'''Fluttershy''': And she won't be embarrassed!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ah! It's the perfect plan!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': All right! I just finished telling everypony to come to our play!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You... did?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! You should've seen how excited they got when they found out Celestia was in it! They said they'd tell their friends, and then their friends would tell ''their'' friends! Everypony in Equestria's gonna see this thing! Uh... did I miss something?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just the bright light of hope being snuffed. But that's okay. If we can't cancel the show, I know what I have to do.
:'''Applejack''': Be honest with Celestia and give the lead role to somepony else?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not a chance!
:'''Applejack''': Twilight, you ''know'' truth is a huge part of friendship.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And so is making another pony's dreams come true. Look, I promised Celestia that this time, she could be a part of the play instead of just watching it. And I plan to keep that promise.
:'''Fluttershy''': But how?

:'''Princess Celestia''': You want to give ''me'' acting lessons?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No-no-no-no-no-no-no. More like a special workshop with other actors. To... take your performance from good to flawless.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Thank you so much, Twilight! This is what I always knew theater must be about – that special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty.
:'''Spike''': Yeah. Heh. That's what it is. Ahem.
:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Princess Celestia, meet Method Mare performers On Stage and Raspberry Beret!
:'''On Stage''': ''Avec pleasure'', your Majesty!
:'''Princess Celestia''': The pleasure is all mine! If there's anything I can do to become a better Equestrian thespian, I will! What do you have planned?
:'''On Stage''': I thought we'd make it up as we go along. [chuckles] Otherwise known as ''improvisation''!
:'''Raspberry Beret''': Yes, and we can start as soon as we get out of this box.
:'''Princess Celestia''': What box?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [distressed whimper]

:[clattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How's it going over here?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That sun will never rise again.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': That's why I have something even better!
:[zip!]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] It's the perfect substitute!
:[pop!]
:[balloon deflating]
:'''Rarity''': It ''was'' the perfect substitute.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Please'' give me something to be happy about.
:'''On Stage''': Let's try visualization! And... you're skiing!
:'''Raspberry Beret''': Whoosh! Whoosh! Oh, it's so snowy today! Brrr! I'm getting chilly!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Should I get you a blanket?
:'''On Stage''': All aboard! The Ponyville Express is leaving the station! Whoo-whoo! Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga...
:'''Princess Celestia''': It is? But I don't see anything.
:'''Raspberry Beret''': Let's be weeping willows in the wind! We are strong in adversity yet supple as we bow to fate.
:'''On Stage''': Well? What do you feel?
:'''Princess Celestia''': Mmmm... nothing. Oh! The classroom floor under my hooves! Does that count?
:[clunk]

:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do I wanna know?
:[clanking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wait for it...
:[flames crackling]
:'''Applejack''': ''Pinkie Pie!''
:[splash!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whaaaat? It's realistic! The sun is just like a burning marshmallow!

:[water dripping]
:[whirring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What are they doing now?
:'''Spike''': [sighs] The simplest acting exercise they could think of – a game of charades.
:'''Raspberry Beret''': A puppy! A duck-billed platypus! Antidisestablishmentarianism! Oh, I give up! What?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': My love for Equestria and all the ponies in it! Twilight, you felt what I was emoting, didn't you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [stuttering] Yeah!
:'''Spike''': [to On Stage] Now, that's the best acting we've seen all day.

:[indistinct chattering, orchestra tuning up]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay! I tried and tried and tried! But we have to face facts. We can't make Celestia an actress. So there's only one thing to do!
:'''Applejack''': Tell her the truth finally?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''No!''
:'''Applejack''', '''Rarity''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Starlight Glimmer''', and '''Fluttershy''': [groans]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've rewritten the script to give Celestia a more artistic part with no lines.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And to make sure the show's a hit, I've whipped up the biggest, bestest, flashiest fake sun ever!
:'''All but Pinkie Pie''': [gasps]
:[fuses sizzling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Pinkie? That looks unsafe.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Why would untested magic fireworks that I bought in a back alley from Trixie at midnight be unsafe?
:[fireworks exploding]
:[boom!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [coughing]
:[water splashing]
:[crash!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [blows]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [anguished shriek] ''I can't take it anymore!'' It was supposed to be a simple play! Just one simple play! And then everything goes wrong, from the stage to the props, right down to the ''worst! Lead! Actress! In Equestria!'' [panting]
:[curtain flapping]
:'''All but Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]

:'''Princess Celestia''': Twilight, if you honestly thought I was a bad actress, why didn't you tell me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to insult your acting! It's just, I-I got so stressed! But... that's no excuse for what I said. You have every right to be upset with me.
:'''Princess Celestia''': I'm not upset because you insulted my acting.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're not?
:'''Princess Celestia''': I'm upset because, in all the time we've known each other, I thought I taught you about the importance of friendship, trust, and honesty!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Celestia, wait!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No!
:[thud]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You can't fly away now! Look!
:'''Fluttershy''': Ponies are taking their seats for the show.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs] Standing room only! Did I do a good job of advertising for this thing or what? Sorry.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We can't put on a show with no lead actress!
:'''Applejack''': You go find Celestia. We'll figure out a way to stall this thing 'til you get back.
:'''Spike''': Good luck. Nopony's gonna volunteer to try to tame ''that''.
:'''Rarity''': No ''pony'' indeed.
:'''Spike''': [gulps]

:'''Spike''': So... [chuckles nervously] Ahem. Uh, who likes juggling?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Princess Celestia! Please wait! Can we talk?
:'''Princess Celestia''': I'm afraid I haven't much to say, Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All right then. Just listen. You've guided me since I was a filly. You've given me knowledge and advice and friendship. Just once, I wanted to be able to give something back to ''you''. I know what I did was wrong. I should've told you the truth. But I promised you could be in our play. I had to make it work. Nothing would make me feel worse than knowing I disappointed you.
:'''Princess Celestia''': You really mean that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course! I look up to you more than any pony I've ever met! I hate to let you down. Like I did.
:'''Princess Celestia''': [sighs] You had good intentions, Twilight. But you know that the truth is always better than a well-meant lie. Didn't Applejack remind you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] About a hundred times. And now, because I didn't listen to her, I've ruined your whole ones-versary.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Well... I don't know about that. Isn't there an old saying? "The show must go on"? There may be a way for us to save the play yet.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But how? I mean, if I'm being completely honest... you're not an actress.
:'''Princess Celestia''': No. But I ''am'' a princess.

:[crowd booing]
:'''Spike''': Ugh! Good news – free food. [chewing] Bad news – this play is officially a disaster.
:'''Princess Celestia''': Fortunately, ''I'' know a thing or two about how to deal with those.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You came back!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Yes. But let's celebrate later. Right now, we have a show to do!
:'''Rarity''': But... but... but how?! The audience is about to riot! We have no backdrop! And our lead actress is—!
:[squeak]
:'''Rarity''': Uhhhh...
:'''Princess Celestia''': No longer in that role. Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie, Twilight, go calm the audience. Let them know the play will start in just a minute.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Rainbow Dash, bring us some clouds and place them behind the stage. There, that's our new backdrop. Starlight, do you have a copy of the script?
:[magic zap]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Spike, you narrate the play. Fluttershy will be our new lead.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my. Me? Playing ''you''? While you watch me playing you? Oh, no. Oh, no. I think my stage fright is coming back. [hyperventilating]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Visualize with me. You're a princess. Regal. Commanding. Confident. Feel the rising sun's warmth. Equestria needs you.

:'''Spike''': Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard that it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it.
:[crowd laughing]
:'''"Rainbow Stars"''': You call ''those'' great sorcerers?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no! Hecklers! What should we do?
:'''Princess Celestia''': [whispering] Spike! Improvise!
:'''Spike''': Y-Yes. And, uh... raising the sun each day was super draining. But you can see that for yourselves, right? I mean, do these guys look beat-up or what? Star Swirl's so stressed, he's got kinks in his horn!
:[crowd laughing]
:'''Spike''': But that's okay. 'Cause it turns out Celestia had a special power to raise the sun all by herself!
:'''Fluttershy''': It's time for a new day in Equestria!
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ah! In all the commotion, we forgot we don't have a sun! What do we do?!
:'''Princess Celestia''': We play charades.
:[crowd ooh-ing and ahh-ing]
:[crowd cheering]
:'''On Stage''': My goodness! I had no idea this production would have such elaborate special effects!

:'''Princess Celestia''': Judging by how many flowers the audience threw, it seems our play was a success.
:'''Fluttershy''': I just feel bad you never got a chance to actually be ''in'' it.
:'''Princess Celestia''': You shouldn't. I never felt I had to be ''on stage'' to be a part of the show. All I ever wanted was to share an honest bond of creativity, artistry, and happiness with my friends. And that's exactly what I got to do.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you for saving our play, Princess Celestia.
:'''Princess Celestia''': You're welcome, Twilight. But from now on, none of you will have to call me "Princess" anymore.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Spike''': Huh?
:'''Spike''': Wait, what? We don't?
:'''Princess Celestia''': No. I had so much fun tonight, I've decided to give up my crown, step down from the throne, and devote all of my time to the theater!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Y-You... ''what?!''
:'''Princess Celestia''': Gotcha! Maybe I'm not such a bad actress after all.
:'''All''': [laughing]

:[pounding on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Mail Pony''': [clears throat] Morning, Sunburst.
:'''Sunburst''': What? Oh! Hi! [chuckles nervously] You know, no matter how many times I read it, ''Houyhnhnm's Guide to Magical Arcana'' never gets boring.
:'''Mail Pony''': If you say so. I've got another letter for you. From Sire's Hollow.
:'''Sunburst''': Mm-hmm. Sure thing.

:'''Sunburst''': What's this? Could I be experiencing the cerebration transmogrification effect described in chapter seventeen—?
:[thud]
:'''Sunburst''': Oh. My cutie mark is glowing. My cutie mark is glowing! I know what this means! Why am I yelling?!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Sunburst''': Princess Twilight, what an honor this is! I-I mean, it is, right? ''I'm'' called for a friendship mission?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You sure are. And it must be a special one. Nopony outside of Ponyville has ever been called before.
:'''Spike''': If you need some pointers, let me know. I've been on my fair share of missions.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You've been on ''one'', Spike.
:'''Spike''': And that's my fair share.
:[door opens]
:'''Sunburst''': Starlight! You mean we've both been called? This is great!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [depressed] Yeah... Great...
:'''Sunburst''': Aren't you excited? You and me on a mission together!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans]
:'''Sunburst''': I'm... sorry. Are you not excited to go on a mission with me?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': No. Uh, no! I mean, yes. Heh. Totally excited about us going together. Just... not so excited about ''where''.
:'''Sunburst''': Sire's Hollow?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yep. Home.
:'''Sunburst''': [deflated] Oh. Great.
:'''Spike''': You know, I can go if you two don't want to. I am kind of an expert.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Starlight Glimmer''', and '''Sunburst''': [groans]

:[train chugging]
:[indistinct conversations]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] It's not that I don't ''want'' to go home. It's just that whenever I do, my dad treats me like a filly. Like nothing's changed since I was a foal.
:'''Sunburst''': Huh.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know. I'm a horrible daughter.
:'''Sunburst''': N-No, no! My mom actually does kind of the same thing.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?
:'''Sunburst''': I don't even have to go home. She sends me letters constantly asking about my plans for the future. [imitating Stellar Flare] "You're a grown-up pony, Sunburst! You need a plan!" [sighs] I haven't been home in a while either.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hmph. We'll just have to explain to our parents that we're on an important friendship mission so they can't bother us.
:'''Sunburst''': Do you really think that will work?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Nope!
:[brakes hissing]
:[train whistle]
:[train chugging]
:'''Sunburst''': [sniffs, sighs] The great thing about home is it always stays just how you le—

:'''Sunburst''': Augh!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Where did ''that'' come from?
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:'''"Ever Essence"''': Essence?
:'''Sunburst''': Essence of what?
:'''"Ever Essence"''': You tell me.

:'''Sunburst''': [coughing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What is it?
:'''Sunburst''': Uh... chocolate maybe?
:'''"Ever Essence"''': Not chocolate maybe. Chocolate definitely! And all of the benefits with none of the drawbacks.
:'''Sunburst''': Didn't this used to be a fruit stand?
:'''"Ever Essence"''': I don't know what it ''used to be''. The Sire's Hollow Development Committee determined what it ''is''.
:'''Sunburst''': The Sire's Hollow Development what? Where do ponies buy fruit?
:'''"Ever Essence"''': You can get a fruit smoothie two doors down.
:'''Sunburst''': All the shops are different. Everything's changed!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Not everything. ''That's'' the same as it ever was.
:[door opens]
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': Sorry. Our bookstore's been declared a site of historical significance by the Sire's Hollow Preservation Society.
:'''"Minty Mocha"''': You'll have to experience the books from here. That's why windows are see-through.
:[door slams]
:'''Sunburst''': What?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Preservation Society? What is happening around here?
:'''Firelight''': I'll explain it to you, sugarplum! [chuckles] You are just as cutesy-wutesy as ever!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [muffled] Dad! [normally] Quit it! What is going on?
:'''Firelight''': Oh, just a father wanting to preserve our town's rich history for his little pumpky-wumpkin! [chuckles]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dad, you promised no "pumpky-wumpkin"'s in public!
:'''Sunburst''': [stifled laughter]
:'''Firelight''': [whispering] Sorry, chipmunk cheeks.
:[smack!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Don't. You're preserving the whole town? That's crazy!
:'''Stellar Flare''': That's exactly what I told him! I said, "Firelight, you're crazy!"
:'''Sunburst''': Mom?
:'''Stellar Flare''': Our village needs the same thing you do, Sunburst – a clear plan for the future.
:[snip!]
:'''Stellar Flare''': That's why I started the Sire's Hollow Development Committee. And I've got plans for this little town. Big plans!
:'''Firelight''': Listen here, Stellar Flare! I'm not gonna let you turn our historical heritage into Las Pegasus!
:'''Stellar Flare''': And ''I'm'' not gonna let you turn it into a museum!
:'''Firelight''' and '''Stellar Flare''': [growling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': W-Wait. Are you two fighting over this?
:'''Sunburst''': Like having a friendship problem?
:'''Stellar Flare''': Oh, there's no problem.
:'''Firelight''': Because there ''is'' no friendship!
:'''Sunburst''': Well, the good news is we know why we're here.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [huffs]

:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] Maybe we should've sent Spike after all.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sunburst and I were called here to do a job, and it looks like you two are it.
:'''Stellar Flare''': You mean ''your'' success depends on ''us''?
:'''Sunburst''': Uh...
:'''Firelight''': And you have to hang out with us the whole time you're here?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Um...
:'''Stellar Flare''': Well, I'll hear what you have to say. But every plan I've made for this town is perfectly reasonable.
:'''Firelight''': Good luck convincing me my preservation efforts don't make sense.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': [sighs]

:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So we can't hold the books?
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': [laughing] No!
:'''Sunburst''': Can ''you'' hold the books?
:'''"Minty Mocha"''': No.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So nopony can ''read'' the books?
:'''Firelight''': [chuckles] Isn't she adorable? [chuckles]

:[gate clanking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!

:'''"Ever Essence"''': You can call them... mm... "smells". But I call them essence!
:[spritz]
:'''Sunburst''': [coughing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sniffs] Fruity.
:'''Sunburst''': Too bad there's nowhere to get ''actual'' fruit.
:'''Stellar Flare''': In the future, all ponies will drink their fruit!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': [slurping]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [coughing]

:[thud]
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': One hundred percent ancient pony grains! Just like the town founders ate! Hope you like crust!
:[crunch, thud]

:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
:[gate creaking]
:'''Automated voice''': Welcome to Sire's—!
:'''Stellar Flare''': Okay, it's annoying. I get it.

:'''Firelight''': Maybe my preservation efforts were a little over the top.
:[crash!]
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': [groans] Oh, no.
:'''Stellar Flare''': And I might have been trying to turn the town into a shopping mall.
:'''Firelight''': Well, whatever direction the town takes from now on, how about we work together on it?
:'''Stellar Flare''': Deal! Sunburst, you should move closer to Ponyville. After this success, I'm sure the Princess of Friendship will want to send you on more missions.
:[smack!]
:'''Sunburst''': That's not really how it works. Oh, look at the time! We should get going now that we solved the friendship problem, right, Starlight?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah... The thing is, I don't think we did solve it. When we solve a friendship problem, our cutie marks are supposed to glow.
:'''Firelight''': Aw, don't be disappointed, puddin'. Your papa will work this out for ya.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Heh. My papa wasn't called by the map in Twilight's castle. ''I'' was.
:'''Stellar Flare''': How are you gonna explain this to the princess? What's your plan if she fires you from friendship quests?
:'''Sunburst''': Mom! She doesn't—! It-It's not—!
:'''Stellar Flare''': Use your words, Sunburst.
:'''Sunburst''': [angry groan]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I guess you two weren't the problem we were sent to solve after all.
:'''Stellar Flare''': So now you don't even know why you're here? Ah! We have to figure this out before we run out of time!
:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] Mom, there isn't a time limit.
:'''Firelight''': So you're here for an extra long visit? [laughs] You can stay in your old room, punkie wunk! It's just like you left it!
:[guitar riff]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [whispering] We need to find this friendship problem now!
:'''Firelight''': Now, I know you have your little job to do, but Stellar and I know the town a lot better than you two.
:'''Stellar Flare''': That's right! Neither of you have been home in ages. You're gonna need our help to succeed!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I guess that makes sense...
:'''Firelight''' and '''Stellar Flare''': [chuckling]
:'''Stellar Flare''': I already have some ideas!
:'''Firelight''': Me, too!
:'''Sunburst''': I think I liked it better when they were fighting.

:[chalk tapping]
:'''Firelight''': Okay! Now that I've explained how Sire's Hollow was founded, we can start to explore all the possible friendship problems that might have developed over time.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [inhales] I appreciate the history lesson, Dad, but I need to find the problem now. In the present.
:'''Firelight''': Aw, now, hon-bun. How are you gonna do that without all the backstory, huh? Oh! Of course I know how hard it is for you to sit still and focus, soooo... would it help you pay attention to hold on to your bwankie?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [growling]

:'''Stellar Flare''': Now, you've had a little setback. But don't worry. I know exactly what you need to do.
:'''Sunburst''': Make a plan?
:'''Stellar Flare''': Already got one! Step one – interview the suspects. Step two – use your talents to solve the issue. Step three – get the Princess of Friendship to send you on more missions!
:'''Sunburst''': Mom! It does not work like that!
:'''Stellar Flare''': Uh-huh.
:[beat]
:'''Stellar Flare''': [clears throat]
:'''"Ever Essence"''': [poorly acted] Oh! Thank goodness you are here! These two ponies refuse to use my essences.
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': Maybe because we don't like to cover our natural scent!
:'''Stellar Flare''': [clears throat irritably]
:'''"Ever Essence"''': Ugh.
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': Ugh.
:'''"Minty Mocha"''': [sighs] [poorly acted] And she refuses to buy our books.
:'''"Ever Essence"''', '''"Raspberry Latte"''', and '''"Minty Mocha"''': [poorly acted] Surely this is a friendship problem.
:'''Sunburst''': Ugh! It needs to be a ''real'' friendship problem! You can't just make one up! [angry groan]
:'''Stellar Flare''': This is what happens when we don't rehearse! Ugh!

:'''Firelight''': Starlight? Sweetie? I found a really old town bylaw that nopony agrees on. Apparently, we're not supposed to prance or canter after dinnertime. Could that be the problem? Silly-filly?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whew! What are ''you'' doing?
:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] Hiding from my mother. She started making up friendship problems for me to solve.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [scoffs] My dad won't even let me talk to anypony in case they're "strangers". I'm a grown mare!
:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] We're never going to find the friendship problem with them around, let alone solve it.
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': Maybe you two should start looking for it on your own? [crunching]

:[lamp clicks]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [whispering] Okay! So we wanted to talk to all of you, you know, in private.
:'''Sunburst''': [whispering] Just to see if there were issues any of you had with your friends.
:'''"Ever Essence"''': [whispering] Got it. Just one question. Why are we whispering?
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': They're avoiding their parents.
:'''"Ever Essence"''', '''"Raspberry Latte"''', and '''"Minty Mocha"''': Ohhhh... [various agreement]
:'''Sunburst''': No. Not avoiding. Just... taking a break.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah. We needed to focus. B-But we're definitely not avoiding them.
:'''"Raspberry Latte"''': So you're whispering with all of us in the darkest corner of the shop where nopony can possibly see because you're ''not'' avoiding them?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Sunburst''': Uh, but they definitely can't hear us in here, right?
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': No way! This is the antiquities section. Nopony ever comes back here.
:'''Firelight''': There you are! But what are you doing in here? [gasps] Is the friendship problem in my favorite section of the bookstore?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': [groans]

:'''Firelight''': ...And then, I thought the best way to look for a friendship problem in the present...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dad!
:'''Firelight''': ...was to look back in our town history even farther!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [angry groan]
:'''Stellar Flare''': Sunburst! Oh, finally! Now, I know you don't want me to make ''up'' a problem, but what if I start one?
:'''Sunburst''': That's not how this—!
:'''Stellar Flare''': I mean, nopony ever became a success by following ''all'' the rules, right?
:'''Sunburst''': [nickers angrily]
:'''Stellar Flare''': [to Firelight] How are things on your end?
:'''Firelight''': Couldn't be better! New leads and such!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Guys...?
:'''Stellar Flare''': We really are providing excellent assistance, aren't we?
:'''Sunburst''': Guys!
:'''Firelight''': I dare say our children should be grateful for our help.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ''Guys!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': ''We don't want your help!''

:'''Stellar Flare''': I'm sorry. You don't want our help?
:'''Firelight''': [chuckles] That's... That's ridiculous! What reason could you possibly have for that?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Because you're driving us crazy!
:'''Stellar Flare''': Oh, really? And just how am I driving you crazy?
:'''Sunburst''': By always coming up with plans! I don't need a plan! I mean, maybe I do, but it'll be mine, not yours!
:'''Stellar Flare''': [choking up] Well... I'm sorry for trying to help! [crying]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And ''you're'' not any better! I'm not a filly! I'm a grown pony with a job to do, and I'll do it on my own!
:'''Firelight''': Well. I'll let you get to it then.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Great. Now we have to smooth things over with our parents on top of finding and solving a friendship problem.
:'''Sunburst''': It's almost like our relationship with our parents ''is'' the friendship problem.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You don't think that's it, do you?
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': [clears throat] That's what all of us think.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans, collapses] Why couldn't we have been sent to stop a war or something?!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dad?
:'''Firelight''': Hello, ''Ms.'' Glimmer. How is your friendship problem search going? I only ask as an interested observer, since I know you are an adult who's capable of doing things without help from anypony else. [whimpers]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually... I think Sunburst and I figured out what it is.
:'''Firelight''': So Stellar and I weren't really helpful after all.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, we haven't actually solved it. And I don't think we can. Not without you.

:'''Stellar Flare''': [sniffs]
:[spritz]
:'''Stellar Flare''': [coughing] Pungent. Ugh. [to Sunburst] Oh. Did you come by to be driven crazy by more of your mother's plans?
:'''Sunburst''': No, I came to apologize.
:'''Stellar Flare''': Well, it's going to take more than an apology to make up for telling me you don't want my help finding your friendship problem.
:'''Sunburst''': Oh, I'm not sorry for that. Starlight and I already figured out what the problem is.
:'''Stellar Flare''': This is a terrible apology.
:'''Sunburst''': Well, if you come with me and help fix it, I'll give you a better one.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Usually, Twilight or one of our other friends gets called to a place with a friendship problem to fix.
:'''Sunburst''': But Starlight and I realized we came here to fix a friendship problem we already had.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm sorry I've been avoiding coming home, Dad. But you can't keep treating me like a foal.
:'''Firelight''': I'm sorry, sugarbun. [sighs] I just know how hard things were for you when you left home. I guess I wanted you to feel safe, like... when you were young.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Dad, I know I've made some mistakes, and I'll probably make a bunch more. But I learn from them. I think that's what growing up is.
:'''Sunburst''': I'm sorry I never told you how much your plans bothered me, and I know you just want me to succeed. But I need to do that on my own.
:'''Stellar Flare''': I remember how lost you were when you flunked out of magic school. I thought as long as you had a plan, you'd never feel that way again.
:'''Sunburst''': You don't have to worry, Mom. I need to find my own way. And I definitely don't feel lost anymore.
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''"Cracked Wheat"''': [crying] That's so beautiful!

:'''Stellar Flare''': The glowing cutie mark is such a symbol of accomplishment. I don't suppose there's a way for you to get it to glow all the time.
:'''Sunburst''': [chuckles] Pretty sure it doesn't work that way.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Not unless we solved a friendship problem every few seconds, and I kinda hope this one will be it for a while.
:'''Firelight''': You know, it seems to me your map is saying we're not just your parents. Heh. We're your friends, too.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I guess so.
:'''Firelight''': So if I promise to treat you less like a little filly and more like a friend, will you visit more?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Absolutely. Mmm.
:'''Sunburst''': And if you start to drive me crazy again, I'll tell you instead of never coming home.
:'''Stellar Flare''': That's lovely of you to say, dear. But you know, I can always visit you.
:'''Firelight''': Stellar, you're a genius! [laughs] How do you feel about a road trip?
:'''Stellar Flare''': I might have a few plans for that.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Sunburst''': [chuckling nervously]

:[whooshing]
:[papers fluttering]
:'''Yona''': Huh?
:[whooshing]
:'''Silverstream''': Whoa!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?
:'''Applejack''': You're just in time. But it's gonna be me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, right. I got this one nailed.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy!
:'''Applejack''': [groans] Again?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on!
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning.
:[camera flashes]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. Me, neither.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Congratulations, Fluttershy!
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Next item of business – I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?
:[pages flapping]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning. Add that together, and what do you get?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask—
:'''Applejack''': I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork.
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles] I wouldn't say "better". Just a little more qualified. No offense.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
:'''Applejack''': [stutters]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [stutters]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Both of you are teamwork experts. If the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education.
:'''Applejack''': Of course!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Totally!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [groans, chuckles]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Ocellus''': I've never been on a field trip before.
:'''Smolder''': Yeah, what's the point of this exactly?
:'''Gallus''': Getting out of the classroom. Duh.
:'''Yona''': Yak best at field-tripping! [grunts]
:'''Silverstream''': That's what we're doing?! So fun! [grunts]
:'''Sandbar''': [chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship.
:'''Applejack''': Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa!
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles nervously] With ''us'' in charge. Meanin' mostly me.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. Good one.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?
{|
|
:'''Applejack''':
:Shed buildin'!
|
:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:Canoe racing!
|}
:'''Silverstream''': No... way. We get to do both?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first?
:'''Applejack''': Heh. Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together!

:'''Applejack''': [deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath. What do you smell?
:'''Gallus''': [inhale] Uh, yak?
:'''Yona''': [sniffing] Mm-hmm!
:'''Applejack''': Nope. Try again.
:'''Ocellus''': Um, apples?
:'''Applejack''': And...? Anyone? Anyone? No? The promise of... teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard work and honest sweat.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship?
:'''Applejack''': Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just "Teacher of the Month" kind o' ponies.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whatever. Let's just get this done so we can move on to ''my'' activity.

:[montage music]
:[hammering]
:[sawing]
:'''Applejack''': That's it! Measure twice and cut once! Haste makes waste! Slow and steady!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Emphasis on the slow.
:[whoosh]
:[thudding]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': Rainbow Dash! Ya can't build an apple shed like that!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Oh, yeah? I just did!
:[thud]
:'''Sandbar''': Whoa! No way!
:'''Rest of Young Six''': Whoa!
:'''Gallus''': Impressive... if you can call an apple shed impressive.
:'''Applejack''': Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, sorry, can't hear you. Too busy practicing my "Teacher of the Month" pose. [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, come on! These students are ''totally'' gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done!
:'''Applejack''': No! They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done ''right''!
:'''Smolder''': Yeah... This isn't awkward at all...

:[montage music continues]
:[wood creaking]
:[hammering]
:'''Applejack''': Steady... Steady... Take 'er nice and slow...
:[creaking]
:'''Applejack''': Little to the left...
:[creaking]
:'''Applejack''': Uh, a hair to the right...
:[creaking]
:'''Applejack''': Now, a hoof shavin' higher...
:[creaking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls] ''Just bring it down already!''
:'''Gallus''' and '''Smolder''': [yelps]
:'''Applejack''': [yelps]
:[crash]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles nervously]
:'''Applejack''': I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'.
:'''Yona''': Yak side! [grunts]
:[thud]
:'''Yona''': [chuckles nervously] Uh...
:'''Applejack''': [sighs]
:'''Ocellus''': Um, professors? I'm a little confused about teamwork now.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's because you need a different teacher. Follow me! Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed!
:'''Applejack''': [growls]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?!
:[cricket chirping]
:'''Gallus''': Is that even a thing?
:'''Sandbar''': First I've heard of it.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off. That means you gotta move fast! Any questions?
:'''Yona''': Uh, Yona has questions.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No time for 'em! Get in the boat!
:'''Applejack''': You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.
:[splashing]
:'''Yona''': Yak not like water.
:'''Ocellus''': Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle.
:'''Yona''': [weak whistling]
:'''Gallus''': We got you, Yona.
:'''Yona''': [yelping]
:[thud]
:'''Applejack''': Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We'll see about that.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies!
:'''Applejack''': Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Slower... Focus on your paddle technique, y'all.
:'''Silverstream''': Woo-hoo! We're really going now!
:'''Smolder''': So... when do we get to the part when we move?
:[water splashing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': When everycreature starts listening to ''me'', the leader of ''my'' activity, ''Applejack''! Now stroke!
:[water splashing]

:[water rushing]
:[watch ticking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Dig in, team! We can still beat that record!
:'''Applejack''': Stop!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Go!
:'''Ocellus''': Which way do we go?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Left!
:'''Applejack''': Right!
:'''Silverstream''': Aye-aye, captains! Wait, what?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Left! I can see the finish line from here!
:'''Applejack''': If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who cares about a few fish?
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, professors?
:'''Applejack''': You'll care plenty when they bite ya!
:'''Sandbar''': Guys?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We'll just go around them!
:'''Sandbar''': ''Rock!''
:'''All''': [screaming]
:[crash!]

:[water rushing]
:'''All''': [gasping, coughing]
:'''Silverstream''': [giggling]
:'''Yona''': [panicked whistling] Oof! [grunting]
:[rip!]
:'''Silverstream''': I love field trips!
:'''Applejack''': I hope you're happy.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Obviously not! Because there goes our new speed record!
:'''Yona''': [panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim!
:[transformation zap]
:'''Ocellus''': That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do!
:'''Yona''': [panicked whistling, coughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How's the canoeing... going?
:'''Smolder''': About as good as the apple shed building.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!
:'''Applejack''': I did not!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Did too!
:'''Applejack''': Did not!
:'''Gallus''': Yup. It's been like this all day.
:'''Sandbar''': I wouldn't say ''all'' day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We are! Mostly.
:'''Applejack''': We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field trip!
:'''Applejack''': H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count Rainbow Dash for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to build a shed.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No way! ''You're'' the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish.
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all.
:'''Applejack''': Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the— [muffled]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Field trip?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack?
:'''Applejack''': Right as rain and twice as fresh!
:[hoof-bump]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fine. But ''I'm'' picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': Right!
:'''Applejack''': See? We're agreein' already.

:'''Applejack''': Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right?
:'''Smolder''': Ugh. Here we go again.
:'''Applejack''': Where to, Rainbow Dash?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes ''you'' happy makes ''me'' happy.
:'''Applejack''': Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you.
:'''Applejack''': Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to ''you''.
:'''Yona''': Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way!
:'''Applejack''': Hey! Where are y'all goin'?

:[montage music]

:'''Ocellus''': I think we've gone in the same circle five times.
:'''Sandbar''': Only because ''someponies'' won't make up their minds about which way to go.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?
:'''Applejack''': Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles] No, no. ''I'' insist.
:'''Applejack''': Heh. But ''I'' insisted first.
:'''Silverstream''': Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost.
:'''Smolder''': Ugh.
:[whoosh]
:'''Smolder''': We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack?
:'''Applejack''': Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is, if-if you think a bridge is a good idea.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Only if ''you'' want to build a bridge.
:'''Gallus''': ''Stop!'' Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done.
:'''Applejack''': Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cooperation!
:'''Applejack''': Togetherness!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You are so right!
:'''Applejack''': Only as right as you are!
:'''Smolder''': ''Okay!'' We'll build a bridge! What do we use?

:'''Ocellus''': [yawns]
:[crickets chirping]
:'''Applejack''': [muffled] Why use a branch when you can use a vine? [grunting] Whoa!
:'''Young Six''': [gasps]
:'''Applejack''': [grunting]
:'''Young Six''': [sighs]
:[crack]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Why didn't I think of branches to begin with? They're so— [yelping] ...easy to work with.
:'''Young Six''': [gasps]
:[wind whistling]
:'''Applejack''': [muffled] Come on now... [grunting] These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not to disagree, but these here branches are the way to— [screams]
:'''Applejack''': [screams]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [screaming] Help!
:'''Ocellus''': Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something.

:[vines creaking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting] I can't get out!
:'''Applejack''': Let me try. [grunting]

:[teeth snapping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Let me guess. Bite-acudas?
:[splashing]
:'''Applejack''': Mm-hmm.
:[teeth snapping]
:'''Applejack''': And they look mighty hungry.
:'''Sandbar''': We gotta get our professors out of there! Anycreature have a plan?
:'''Gallus''': Leave 'em hangin'?
:'''Silverstream''': What?!
:'''Gallus''': I'm kidding! ...Kinda.
:'''Ocellus''': We need to work fast! And together!
:[vines snapping]
:'''Smolder''': But mainly fast.
:'''Applejack''': I hate to admit it, but—
:[vines snapping]
:'''Applejack''': ...this whole mess is kinda our fault.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. No trophy is worth getting eaten over.
:'''Applejack''': So what do ya say? You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I thought you'd never ask.
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Applejack''': [screams]
:'''Ocellus''': Aah! Don't worry. I'm just the distraction.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ocellus?!
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] You nearly scared the cutie marks off us!
:[splashing]
:'''Ocellus''': [roars, chomp-chomp]
:[splashing]
:[vines snapping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Applejack''': [screaming]

:'''Yona''': Yak smash! [grunting]
:'''Sandbar''': [grunting]
:'''Smolder''': [grunting]
:'''Yona''': [laughing, grunting]
:'''Sandbar''': Welcome back, professors!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Now, ''that'' was a rescue!
:'''Applejack''': And y'all did it together!
:'''Young Six''': [cheering]
:'''Gallus''': No big. Those fish weren't even a thing.
:'''Ocellus''': [growls]
:'''Gallus''': [screams]
:'''Ocellus''': [chuckles] Oops. Sorry.
:'''Silverstream''': [giggles] Best... field trip... ever!

:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Huh? How was the field trip? What did you all learn?
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Applejack''': Uhhhh...
:'''Yona''': Yak learn ponies smart!
:'''Silverstream''': Yeah! Professors Applejack and Rainbow Dash were such good teachers!
:'''Gallus''': It was kind of crazy genius. They showed us what ''not'' to do so we'd figure out what we ''should'' do.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Really...?
:'''Sandbar''': It took us a while to get it.
:'''Smolder''': Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home.
:'''Silverstream''': But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is.
:'''Gallus''': Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment.
:'''Ocellus''': We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule another one right away.
:'''Young Six''': [cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?
:'''Applejack''': To tell you the truth... yeah.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, not ''all'' the time. I agreed with you for the whole nature walk.
:'''Applejack''': Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You were the one doing the "angling"!
:'''Applejack''': [scoffs] You were more like fandanglin'!

:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:What does that even mean?! No one here can understand your country bumpkin talk...!

:[oven timer ticks]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [groans]
:'''Spike''': You said it, Big Mac. This is taking forever! I know it's wrong to cut corners when it comes to gifts from the heart, but this is an emergency, right?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Spike''': Discord? A little help? Discord!
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [whispering]
:'''Spike''': Yeah? Oh! Good idea! [clears throat] Captain Wuzz! Are you prepared to enter the world of ''Ogres & Oubliettes''?
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Huzzah, fellow adventurers! Shall we storm the ramparts of Squizard's castle to reclaim Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility?
:[beat]
:'''Discord''': You ''did'' summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of ''Ogres & Oubliettes'', did you not?
:'''Spike''': Uh, sort of. But do you think you could magically hurry up this pie real quick first?
:'''Discord''': You seem to be mixing up [poof!] the Lord of Chaos [poof!] with a second-rate clown magician for hire.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eee... wait!
:'''Spike''': This needs to go in the mail today, or it'll never get to Sugar Belle in time for Hearts and Hooves Day!
:'''Big McIntosh''': [embarrassed giggling]
:'''Discord''': Please. Can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse pushed on you by the greeting card industry?
:'''Big McIntosh''': [clears throat irritably]
:'''Discord''': Fine. You owe me for this. [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Keep your eye on the pie. [à la Doug Henning] It's magic time!
:[poof!]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Discord''': [sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.
:'''Spike''': Well, pies really are Sugar Belle's thing. But I think that makes this all the more special. It shows you're interested in what she cares about.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup!
:'''Spike''': ''And'' he's planning a big romantic Hearts and Hooves dinner. It was my idea to bake the invitation inside.
:'''Discord''': [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': [reading] "Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me in my barn at sunset for a surprise."
:'''Spike''': Pretty clever, huh?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup. [chuckling]
:'''Discord''': Ugh. [snaps fingers]
:[paper wrapping]
:'''Spike''': Awww. "Sugar Belle". See?
:'''Discord''': Well, you two certainly have bought into this romance nonsense hook, line, and sinker.
:'''Spike''': For a formerly friendless immortal despot, you're pretty cynical.
:'''Discord''': I'm a realist. And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real.
:'''Spike''': Aw, come on. You act tough, but deep down, you're a softie. I mean, you don't have tea with Fluttershy every weekend because you like tea.
:'''Discord''': But I ''do'' like tea! Every tea! All the teas! Chamomile, Earl Grey, green, white, yellow, mate, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus... [inhale] ...cinnamon, pumpkin spice.
:'''Big McIntosh''': [groans]
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Tell you what. While Big Mac mails his incredibly romantic gesture, I'll show you the splendors of Hearts and Hooves Day in Ponyville. I bet I can prove you believe in love.
:'''Discord''': Fine. Call it a gentleman's wager. Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
:'''Spike''': Is it, like, a riding mower or...?
:'''Discord''': Tweezers!
:'''Spike''': [gulps]

:[montage music]

:'''Apple Bloom''': Hear ye, hear ye! This special Hearts and Hooves Day meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! First order of business – helpin' my big brother decorate the barn for his big date with Sugar Belle tonight, and... Hello?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': It seems like everypony's got somepony special but us.
:'''Scootaloo''': When's it gonna be our turn?
:[knocking on door]
:'''Sweetie Belle''' and '''Scootaloo''': Huh?
:[door opens]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Huh?
:'''Scootaloo''': [gasps] Who's it from?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Can't tell. It's all smudged, but it looks like it's addressed to... "Belle"? Hmmm...
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [gasps] "Sweetie Belle"!
:[paper tearing]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Somepony certainly went through a lot of trouble for me! On Hearts and Hooves Day!
:'''Scootaloo''': [gasps] You don't think...
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Could it be...?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Hang on a minute. Mysterious package, smudged address, no idea who it's from... Hm. I know what this is. You've got a secret admirer!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheering and laughing]

:'''Spike''': [sighs] Another Hearts and Hooves Day. Love is in the air, Discord. Look at all these happy couples.
:'''Discord''': How can they be happy if they aren't playing ''Ogres & Oubliettes''?
:'''Spike''': As a great dragon poet once wrote to his beloved, "I love you with the utmost clarity. I love you, dear. My sweet, sweet Rarity—" Are you even listening?!
:'''Discord''': Of course. "Love is... something-something, and Discord is great." I don't know. Can we play ''O&O'' now?
:'''Spike''': Sure, after you admit you believe in love and... Sugar Belle!
:[bushes rustle]
:'''Spike''': Big Mac's girlfriend. What's she doing in town so early?
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Well, Sugar Belle, I'm sure Big Mac won't be expecting it.
:'''Spike''': [gasps] She's planning her own romantic surprise for Big Mac? What if she goes to Sweet Apple Acres before Big Mac's ready with ''his'' surprise? We've gotta warn him!
:'''Discord''': [scoffs, snaps fingers]
:[poof!]

:'''Big McIntosh''': [singing] ...ffle, cookin' a souffle...
:[poof!]
:'''Spike''': Aah!
:[thud]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Whoa!
:'''Spike''': [slurring] Mig Bac... Mig Bac...! [groans] I mean, Big Mac! We just saw Sugar Belle! She's at Sugarcube Corner! But I think she's on her way over here now! You gotta keep her away from here until the barn's finished!
:'''Big McIntosh''': [gasps] Eeyup!
:'''Spike''': I wonder what she has planned for him.
:'''Discord''': [chuckles] We don't have to wonder. [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]

:[poof!]
:'''Spike''': Aah!
:[bushes rustle]
:'''Spike''': Ugh! Will you warn me next time you do that?
:[door opens]
:[clop, clop, clop]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Just be honest with him. I'm sure Big Mac will... [continues indistinctly]
:'''Spike''': Ohhhh. She hasn't seen him yet. Take note, Discord. ''This'' is what love is all about.
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': "Spike – Love is about spying in the bushes."
:'''Spike''': Make fun of me all you want. But look at Big Mac's face and tell me you don't believe in love.
:[romantic music]
:'''Discord''': [scoffs]
:'''Sugar Belle''': I hope he'll be okay without me.
:[screech!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [panicked noises]
:[bushes rustle]
:'''Spike''': Oh. Hey. We're just... not spying—
:'''Big McIntosh''': Hush!
:'''Sugar Belle''': I mean, he ''has'' been on his own before. So he'll be fine, right? [sighs] How should I tell Big Mac tonight? "You won't need to come visit me in my village anymore"? "We need to talk."
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Just be honest with him.
:'''Sugar Belle''': You're right. Okay! "We're finished."
:'''Big McIntosh''': [gasps]
:[heart beating]
:[crack]
:[thud]
:'''Discord''': You're right. She ''did'' surprise him.
:'''Spike''': Ugh.

:'''Big McIntosh''': [wailing loudly, gulping]
:'''Spike''': Okay. Things seem bad. Maybe they're really not. Maybe "we're finished" was about the day. Ponies say that, right? Like-like, "Hey, remember yesterday? That's finished, 'cause it's today!"
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': Maybe not that. Oh, I know! Maybe Sugar Belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own, and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with Mrs. Cake, who does that, like, two days a week. N-No, no, three. That's why she won't need you to come to her village anymore, because... she'll already be here!
:[beat]
:'''Spike''': Nah. ''I'' don't even buy that one.
:'''Big McIntosh''': [continues wailing, gulping] She takes pie-bakin' seriously! Why'd I even try?! I bet she thought I... I was makin' fun of her! [continues wailing]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up.
:'''Big McIntosh''': [blows nose]
:'''Discord''': Besides, we can't have you ruining any more of my thousand-year-old monogrammed handkerchiefs. These ''are'' silk, you know. [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]

:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Class is now in session.
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Lesson one – nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': This is how cool guys ''lean'' against things. When you see a guy ''leaning'' against a thing looking this cool, you think, "Wow! That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria. Not a guy who ''leans'' on things that cool."
:'''Spike''': I don't think leaning's gonna help. Am I doing it right? Whoa!
:[thud]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [sighs]
:'''Spike''': We're not like you, Discord. We can't put on a front and pretend not to love. It's impossible.
:'''Discord''': Lesson two – plenty of ponies in the pasture. Right, Big Mac? I know just the gal to make you forget all about Sugar Belle.
:'''Big McIntosh''': You... said... her... [wailing] naaaaaaame!
:'''Discord''': Oy vey... [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Okay. We finished decoratin' the barn for Big Mac, which means we got the rest of the day to ourselves. There's a whole town of possible admirers out there and only three of us. But together, we're gonna get to the bottom of this! Ready? Break! Excuse me! Pipsqueak? Mind answerin' a few questions? No? Late for somethin'? ''Are you Sweetie Belle's secret admirer?!''
:'''Scootaloo''': [to Button Mash] Excuse me! I'm doing a research survey about sending pie in the mail anonymously. Would you say you're pro-that or anti-that?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [to Snips and Snails] Happy Hearts and Hooves Day! Did you boys happen to send any packages to me recently? It's okay to say no! I won't be offended! [whispering] Please say no, please say no, please say no.

:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Sir McBigguns, meet Skellinore. She's a Level 18 Bone Warrior in Squizard's mage army, but only to pay off skeleton student loan debts. Get to know each other, why don't you? [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]
:'''Spike''': Wow. You're really going all out to cheer up Big Mac. I'm impressed.
:'''Discord''': Yes, yes, I'm amazing. Anyway, since we're in the neighborhood, care for a quick game of ''Ogres & Oubliettes''? Like I've been wanting to play all week?!
:'''Spike''': I take it back.
:'''Discord''': I'm helping our friend first and foremost. See for yourself.
:'''Spike''': I think he's showing her a picture of Sugar Belle.
:'''Discord''': What?
:'''Spike''': And now he's crying.
:'''Discord''': No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No, he's not. Let me see that.
:'''Spike''': Don't touch it! I'm looking!
:'''Discord''': Give me that!
:'''Spike''': Cut it out! Discord, quit it!
:[poof!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': She used to do this thing where her-her nose would wrinkle when she laughed. Right there, in that hole where your nose used to be. I never told her how much I loved wrinkle-nose cutie-face... [wailing] and now I never will!
:'''Discord''': Ugh. [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]

:[poof!]
:[thud]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [crying]
:'''Spike''': Okay. I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart. You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve? I hide from it! When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you. Plus, if she can't find you, she can't break up with you.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup. Hup!
:'''Spike''': Ha!
:'''Discord''': [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]
:[door opens]
:'''Scootaloo''': [sighs] I don't get it. We asked every stallion in Ponyville.
:'''Apple Bloom''': [groans] There's gotta be somepony we're missin'. Somepony obvious. Somepony right in front of our noses.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Oh, well. At least the barn's looking great for Big Mac's date.
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Too bad there won't be a date.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Sugar Belle is so lucky to have a non-secret admirer like Big Mac.
:'''Discord''': Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I bet she's gonna take one look at this barn and say, "What did I ever do to deserve this?"
:'''Discord''': [whispering] Yes, what ''did'' she do to deserve this?
:'''Big McIntosh''': She broke my heart.
:'''Discord''': Well, not yet, technically. In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first.
:'''Big McIntosh''': [angrily] Eeyup!

:'''Sugar Belle''': Thanks for the tour of Ponyville, Mrs. Cake.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, my pleasure.
:'''Sugar Belle''': I'm off to surprise Big Mac with the news. Imagine the look on his face when I tell him, "We need to talk."
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, dear me, no! I told you, don't say it that way or he'll think you're breaking up with him.
:'''Sugar Belle''': Break up with him? Never! Why, without my favorite delivery pony, I couldn't imagine being happy ever again. He knows that.
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Good! Save your mix-up for cake batter – that's what I always say! [chuckles]
:'''Sugar Belle''': He's a good listener, that pony. I promise you, no mix-ups.
:[poof!]
:'''Sugar Belle''': Ah! Big Mac!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Sugar Belle... we need to talk.

:'''Big McIntosh''': I know why you're here.
:'''Sugar Belle''': You do?
:'''Big McIntosh''': But I have somethin' to tell ''you'' first.
:'''Sugar Belle''': Oh, can I go first? I'm gonna be—
:'''Big McIntosh''': Stop.
:'''Sugar Belle''': Oh. Why don't we tell each other on three? One—
:'''Big McIntosh''': It's over!
:'''Sugar Belle''': What's over?
:'''Big McIntosh''': You and me. It's over.
:'''Sugar Belle''': Ah... What?
:'''Big McIntosh''': We're breakin' up!
:'''Sugar Belle''': I... don't understand. Why are you breaking up with me? And why are you leaning like that?
:'''Big McIntosh''': I... don't know!
:'''Sugar Belle''': Big Mac, please. Talk to me.
:'''Big McIntosh''': I... You... [loud groan] This is why I don't like talkin'! Words can hurt! ''Words hurt!'' Goodbye, Sugar Belle!
:[door slams]
:'''Sugar Belle''': [crying]

:[sad montage music]

:[door opens]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Big Mac! Oh, thank goodness! You gotta help us with this.
:[rustling]
:'''Spike''': Ugh. Dude, how long have you been ''not'' hiding?
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Oh. I should probably have said something.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Y'all should go.
:'''Spike''': Did ya...? Did she...? Are ya...?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Big Mac, what's goin' on? Where's Sugar Belle?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Just go!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': But we worked so hard on this chart. I think we've almost cracked it. If you could just—
:'''Big McIntosh''': Not right now!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': But I can't stand having a secret admirer who's too scared to tell me who he is!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Maybe he doesn't like talkin'!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': But that doesn't make any sense!
:'''Big McIntosh''': Maybe he used to talk too much, and it only ever got him into trouble!
:'''Spike''': [sighs] What if you're right, Discord? What if love isn't real at all?
:[ding!]
:[poof!]
:'''Big McIntosh''': I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. I'm just mad, and I'm takin' it out on you.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That's okay. I bet it felt good to get it out though.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Actually, it did. Tellin' you how I felt just then... I gotta go!
:'''Spike''': Big Mac! Where are ya goin'?
:'''Big McIntosh''': I gotta talk to Sugar Belle!
:'''Spike''': Discord, you gotta use your magic and...! Guess you have better things to do. Big Mac's gonna need a miracle.

:'''Sugar Belle''': [sighs]
:[clatter]
:'''Sugar Belle''': Oh. All the rotten luck...
:[splash]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Caught ya just in time! We both know I don't like to say much, but I'm gonna say somethin' now. [sighs] Even though I'm hurtin', I wouldn't trade this feelin' for anythin'. Because it'd mean givin' up the good times we had, too. I only broke up with you because you were gonna break up with me. I respect your decision, and you should know you'll always be in my heart.
:'''Sugar Belle''': I didn't want to break up with you.
:'''Big McIntosh''': But... you said you didn't need me to visit anymore. You said I'm gonna be on my own. I-I heard you said "we're finished" when I was hidin' in the bushes.
:[beat]
:'''Big McIntosh''': That sounds worse than it is.
:'''Sugar Belle''': Oh, Big Mac! I was talking about my cousin! I have this wacky cousin who's never been on his own, but I have to let him run my shop on weekends. Which is why you won't be delivering to my village anymore because I'll already be here apprenticing with Mrs. Cake, who does that two days a week. No, three.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Wait 'til I tell Spike!
:'''Sugar Belle''': I'd never break up with you! I suppose there's a lesson here somewhere about communication, talking instead of assuming, or eavesdropping is wrong. Wouldn't you say?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeeeyup!
:'''Sugar Belle''': [giggles, snorts]
:'''Big McIntosh''': Hee-hee. Wrinkle-nose cutie-face. [kisses] You must've been awful confused at my breakin' up with you after you got my pie.
:'''Sugar Belle''': What pie?
:'''Big McIntosh''': You didn't get the pie I sent?
:'''Sugar Belle''': Mm-mm.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Or the invitation?
:'''Sugar Belle''': Uh-uh.
:'''Big McIntosh''': Well, in that case... allow me to escort you to a Hearts and Hooves Day surprise!
:'''Sugar Belle''': [giggles, snorts]

:[birds chirping]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [sighs]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Mind if we join ya?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [chomp] [reading] "Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me—"
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': ''Sugar'' Belle?!
:'''Scootaloo''': You have got to be pulling our hooves!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': It was all a mix-up?!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [laughing]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Oh, it's funny. I've been sitting here feeling sorry for myself for not having a special pony on Hearts and Hooves Day. But remembering all the fun we had, I think I have ''two'' special ponies – my two best friends.
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Scootaloo''': Awwwww...

:'''Spike''': [sighs] And so ends another Hearts and Hooves Day. Despite a bumpy start... and middle... and ending... lot of bumps today... love was in the air.
:'''Discord''': So was confusion, apparently, and a fair number of assumptions.
:'''Spike''': But you have to admit, after seeing everything Big Mac went through, love is a hundred percent real.
:'''Discord''': [humming]
:'''Spike''': Seriously?! Discord, come on! I can't believe you!
:'''Discord''': Who do you think broke Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?
:[thud]
:'''Discord''': Ta-da! Happy Hearts and Hooves Day!
:'''Spike''': You old softie. [laughs] I knew you had a heart.
:'''Discord''': Speaking of how great I am, are you busy for the rest of the night? [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]
:'''Discord''': Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know.
:'''Spike''': ''Ogres & Oubliettes''? I thought you'd never ask! Oh, and... just wondering. No biggie, but... is Skellinore gonna be there?
:'''Discord''': Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton.
:'''Spike''': Well, nopony's perfect.
:'''Discord''': [snaps fingers]
:[poof!]

:'''Rarity''': I do appreciate you showing me the way to the phoenix nests, Spike.
:'''Spike''': Anything for you, Rarity. Besides, I've been meaning to visit Peewee.
:'''Rarity''': He really was an excellent pet. I can't imagine why you set him free.
:'''Spike''': Phoenixes aren't meant to be domesticated. Even in the wild, they like to keep to themselves.
:'''Rarity''': Well, they are beautiful. A few of their feathers will add just the right splash of color to my latest— Spike! What are you doing?
:'''Spike''': Uh, nothing!
:'''Rarity''': Is there something wrong with your face?
:'''Spike''': [sighs] It's a stone scale. It isn't magical or anything like the call of the Dragon Lord. It's just... red. And itchy. [groans] And embarrassing.
:[throbbing]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh, precious pants, that does look uncomfortable. But even I get the odd blemish from time to time. It's nothing to be embarrassed by. You could pay Zecora a visit. She makes a cream that works wonders. Just don't get the shampoo.
:'''Spike''': There's Peewee's parents! But I don't see Peewee.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, maybe he moved out. Everypony has to leave the nest at ''some'' point.
:[fluttering]
:'''Spike''': Peewee!
:'''Peewee''': [squawks]
:[sizzle]
:'''Spike''': Ouch! [scratching]
:'''Rarity''': Perhaps you should pay Zecora a visit sooner rather than later.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] I don't want anypony else to see this. Besides, I'm ''sure'' it'll clear up after a good night's sleep.

:'''Spike''': [snoring]
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe you're still asleep!
:'''Spike''': [groans] Just five more minutes... [continues snoring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's nearly noon, and you promised to help me with my lecture for class today!
:'''Spike''': Noon? Whoa! I slept like a rock! Which reminds me – all that sleep probably cleared up my stone scale!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Um, on second thought... [chuckles nervously] You can go back to sleep if you want.
:'''Spike''': [screams]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[curtains drawing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, what are you doing?
:'''Spike''': Hiding from my hideous face!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sure it feels terrible, but it's just a breakout. It's not the end of the world.
:'''Spike''': That's easy for ''you'' to say. Your face isn't covered in itchy red spots! [scratching]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I used to get terrible breakouts any time I had a final exam with Celestia. Who probably never had a blemish her whole life.
:'''Spike''': Well, I'm not in magic school.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, but these things can be stress-related. And you did spend yesterday with Rarity.
:'''Spike''': [chuckles nervously] What could possibly be stressful about that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] You could try Zecora. She makes a cream that—
:'''Spike''': Works wonders. I've heard. But I'm not leaving the castle until my face is back to its adorable self. [winces]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fine. But you're still gonna help me practice my lecture.
:'''Spike''': [groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [clears throat] The element of generosity and its importance in relation to the other Elements of Harmony—
:'''Spike''': [gags, breathes fire]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] My lecture!
:'''Spike''': I don't know what happened! I just had a sudden case of— [gags]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Spike''': [breathes fire]
:[teleportation zap]
:[fire extinguisher spraying]
:'''Spike''': ...indigestion. I'm so sorry!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] It's okay. I'm sure I can rewrite the lecture from my notes. I have a lot.
:'''Spike''': I can help you with—
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe you should leave the castle after all. And go somewhere less... flammable?
:'''Spike''': [sighs]

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Spike''': Hey there, not handsome.
:'''Rarity''': [singsongy] Oh, Spike! My, what a fetching ensemble you put together. Very noir-esque. [giggles] I believe Shadow Spade herself would approve.
:'''Spike''': Uh, thanks.
:'''Rarity''': But I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking it off.
:'''Spike''': What? Oh, I, uh... I... [muttering lowly]
:'''Rarity''': Sorry, you'll have to speak up. My ears are a little bit clogged or something. It's just that I absolutely must have a model for my phoenix feather dress, and nopony else is available.
:'''Spike''': Sorry, Rarity, but I... I am super busy all day giving... tours of the school!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Really? I thought ''I'' was giving tours today. Guess not. Free day! Whee! Woo-hoo!

:'''Spike''': Classrooms are that way. [groans] Dorms are that way. [groans] Twilight's office is up there. This is a fountain.
:'''Tourist Pony''': [panting] Could you slow down a bit? We've come a long way to see the school, and I don't wanna miss anything.
:'''Spike''': Oh. Um, yeah. [wincing, scratching] Sorry.
:'''Tourist Pony''': I-Is something wrong?
:'''Spike''': What? Why? No! [scratching]
:'''Tourist Pony''': Uh, do all the dragons at this school suffer from scale issues?
:'''Spike''': [low voice] <small>I don't know.</small>
:'''Tourist Pony''': What?
:'''Spike''': [low voice, straining] <small>I don't... know!</small>
:'''Tourist Pony''': I-I'm sorry, did-did you say "firework show"?
:'''Spike''': [low voice] <small>I said...</small> [loudly, echoing] ''I don't know!'' [gasps]

:'''Spike''': [echoing] ''This is the school library! It's one of the most serene spots on campus, where students can spend time in quiet reflection or study! What?!''
:'''Smolder''': Could you please stop shouting? We're trying to do our homework, and it's kind of distracting.
:'''Spike''': [loud voice] ''Was I shouting?!''
:[affirmative muttering]
:'''Spike''': [clears throat, normal volume] I have no idea what you're talking— Ulp! [belches, breathes fire]
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': [gasps and groans]

:'''Spike''': [breathing fire]
:[door opens]
:'''Smolder''': If you're trying to hide, you need to do a better job. All I had to do was follow the smoke.
:[door closes]
:'''Spike''': [low voice, straining] <small>Leave me alone!</small>
:'''Smolder''': What?
:'''Spike''': [low voice, straining] <small>Leave! Me! Alone!</small>
:'''Smolder''': I can't under... Was that "sleeves made of foam"?
:'''Spike''': [low voice] <small>I said, leave</small> [normal voice] me alone! [belches, breathes fire, sighs]
:'''Smolder''': [laughs] Wow! I have seen some pretty bad molts in my time, but yours takes the cake!
:'''Spike''': Molts?
:'''Smolder''': The molt? Super painful stone scales, fire burps, uncontrollable volume shifts? It's all part of growing up dragon. Congrats!
:[smack!]
:'''Spike''': [groans and winces]
:'''Smolder''': Oh. Sorry.

:'''Spike''': No-no-no-no-no. The last time I grew up, I turned into a giant greedy monster.
:'''Smolder''': Greed-induced bigness. That's totally different. The molt is completely normal. Every dragon goes through it. Pretty soon, you'll leave and strike out on your own.
:'''Spike''': Why would I do that?
:'''Smolder''': Have you been living with ponies your whole life?
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh.
:'''Smolder''': Oh. Well, in the Dragon Lands, a molter's loved ones kicks them out at the first stone scale.
:'''Spike''': What? Why?
:'''Smolder''': I think it's biological. We call it the "molt effect". I haven't even told you about the smell.
:'''Spike''': Smell? [sniffs] Ugh!
:'''Smolder''': Yeah. I mean, I love my brother and all, but one whiff, and I was all "See ya!" [sniffs] Speaking of which...
:'''Spike''': Wait! Does the molt effect happen to ponies too? [gasps] Twilight already asked me to leave the castle today. If she kicks me out, where am I gonna live? I'm too young to grow up!
:'''Smolder''': I'm sure you'll find a nice...
:[thud]
:'''Smolder''': ...hoard of gems to guard or a village to terrorize. Oh, now that dragons and ponies are friends, I guess that's off the table.
:'''Spike''': So no creature's gonna wanna be around me?
:'''Smolder''': Oh, I didn't say that. That molt stench is a magnet for predators. Tatzlwurms, hydras, rocs...
:'''Spike''': Dragons are scared of rocks?
:'''Smolder''': R-O-C-S. Rocs? Humongous birds of prey that can snack on a molting dragon like candy!
:'''Spike''': [low voice] <small>So Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?</small>
:'''Smolder''': Seriously, I heard none of that.
:'''Spike''': [loud voice] ''Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?!''
:'''Smolder''': Congrats!
:[door opens]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [shouting] Hey! Is this the shouting closet?! Because I've got a free day, and I'm totally up for some shouting! [sniffs] [normal voice] Also, where's that brussel-sprouts-covered-in-cotton-candy smell coming from? Because it is really interesting.

:'''Spike''': I didn't know where else to go. I can't take the chance that Twilight will kick me out. You aren't feeling any molt effects, are you?
:'''Zecora''': [nose plugged] When it comes to breakouts, I've seen all circumstances. But as with the molt smell... let's not take any chances.
:'''Spike''': [scratches, sighs] Is there anything you can do to cure me?
:'''Zecora''': The ailments you have aren't something to cure. The molt's a condition that dragons endure.
:'''Spike''': [scratches] But if anypony sees or smells me right now, they'll be so grossed out, they'll avoid me forever!
:'''Zecora''': Perhaps we can lessen this strange molt effect. The smell is the most likely cause, I suspect.
:'''Spike''': [low voice] <small>It's all so embarrassing.</small>
:'''Zecora''': I know you are speaking, but I can't hear a thing. Are you talking about teaching asparagus to sing?
:'''Spike''': [low voice] <small>I said it's</small> [loud voice] ''embarrassing!''
:'''Zecora''': If the goal is to not have your friends all depart, perhaps your volume is where we should start.
:[stomach rumbling]
:'''Spike''': Oh, no. [gags, belches, breathes fire, sighs]
:'''Rarity''': Zecora! Hello? Are you there?
:'''Spike''': [loud voice] ''I can't let Rarity see me like this! Please don't let her know I'm here!''
:[knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] Oh, dear! I'm talking even louder than I thought, aren't I?!
:'''Zecora''': I have volume concerns today by the scores. But it seems that I'm ready to help you with yours.
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] Eh, I-I'm sorry?! I can't seem to hear anything! I was hoping you could help! I have no idea what happened! One minute, I was sewing phoenix feathers onto a dress, and the next I couldn't hear my own voice!
:'''Zecora''': Ah, the feathers of that bird can affect ponies' ears. It's a magic ailment I've treated for years.
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] I only know you're talking 'cause your mouth is going up and down. [sighs, sniffs, coughs] [normal volume] Oh, goodness! I hope that incredibly pungent odor belongs to some sort of magical curative. [loudly] I hope you're not busy, but I must have my hearing back! It turns out that I talk to myself while I sew, and without that conversation, I simply can't think!
:'''Zecora''': It's a simple cure, and the directions are clear. Just one or two drops in each of your ears.
:'''Rarity''': [sighs, normal volume] Oh, thank you. You're an ear saver. [loudly] Oh, and while I am here, do you have any blemish cream?! Spike is having some scale issues!
:'''Spike''': [loud voice] ''You have no idea!''
:'''Rarity''': [gasps, normal voice] I think I heard something! [loudly] Your cure is working already!
:'''Zecora''': The cream that you want is just over here. It's a popular potion for all creatures this year.
:'''Rarity''': [sighs, normal voice] Thank you, Zecora.
:[window creaks]
:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] I don't mean to be rude, but I do think your hut could use an airing out!
:'''Zecora''': Rarity's gone. There's no need to hide. [sniffs, groans] Though I wonder if we should continue outside. Can't treat your symptoms down there on the ground. It's safe to come out. There's no ponies around.
:'''Spike''': I'm not hiding from ponies. I'm hiding from ''that''!
:[roc screeches]

:[roc screeches]
:'''Spike''': Did I forget to mention the molt smell attracts predators?
:'''Zecora''': That's something that would've been quite nice to know! But it's not worth discussing right now! We should go!
:[roc screeching]
:'''Spike''': It's only after me! I'll lead it away while you get help! This way, birdy-bird! Molting dragon over here! [grunting and huffing]
:[leaves rustling]
:'''Spike''': Okay, maybe this wasn't a good plan.
:'''Zecora''': You can't hide in a tree! You have to come down! We stand a much better chance on the ground! [screams]
:'''Spike''': Zecora! Bring her back! [groans, scratches]
:[roc screeches]
:'''Spike''': [panting]
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, Spike. What are you doing here?
:'''Spike''': Rarity! You have to get out of here! There's a giant roc trying to eat me! It's got Zecora!
:'''Rarity''': Yes, what? [loudly] I was just at Zecora's, but I'm heading back! I can't read these instructions! Does this say "two drops once a day" or "one drop twice a day"?!
:'''Spike''': Rarity, there's no time! We have to get help!
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] Yes, my ears are completely clogged! Why, Spike! Your stone scales look worse! Oh, here! I picked up just the thing. Ah—
:[roc screeches]
:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:'''Zecora''': Oh, I wish you'd escaped either claw of this bird! But the both of us trapped in the same one's absurd!
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] What?!
:'''Spike''': [groans] Let my ponies go!
:[thudding]
:'''Spike''': Whoa! [breathes fire]
:[roc screeches]
:'''Spike''': [screams, groaning]
:[grinding sounds]
:'''Spike''': [sighs, scratches, wailing groans]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, what are you doing?
:'''Spike''': If my stone scales didn't itch so much and we weren't in immediate danger, this would be [chuckles] really embarrassing!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Danger?
:[roc screeching]
:[teleportation zaps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I was headed to Zecora's to get some cream for your scales. I had no idea you were—
:'''Spike''': [groans] About to be eaten by a giant predator attracted to my molt smell?! [scratches]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Molt smell?
:[roc screeches]
:'''Rarity''': [high-pitched] Twilight!
:'''Spike''': Whoa!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Was that Rarity?
:'''Spike''': And Zecora! I tried to save them, but it's all I can do to stop scratching long enough to dive out of the way when that bird attacks!
:[magic zaps]
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] This isn't the first time I've been in the clutches of a horrible giant creature, but it doesn't get any easier! [cries]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Spike''': [gasps, sighs] Finally! I didn't think that itching would ever stop!
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Spike''': What's happening?! I... I can't move!
:[magic zaps]
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Spike''': What just... happened? Did I just sprout wings? I just sprouted wings!
:[magic zaps]
:[roc screeches]
:'''Spike''': [gasps] I've gotta help them! W-Whoa! Whooaaa! [yelping]
:[thuds]
:[magic zaps]
:'''Spike''': Whoops.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike?! How did you get wings?!
:'''Spike''': I don't know! But they're pretty aweso– Whoa!
:[roc screeches]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Do you think you can fly up and distract him while I work on freeing Zecora and Rarity?
:'''Spike''': Hey, giant chicken! If you like dragons so much, come and get me!
:[beak snapping]
:'''Spike''': Greetings.
:[beak snaps]
:[stomach rumbling]
:'''Spike''': [breathes fire]
:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike!
:'''Zecora''': I know that the molt produced surprising things. But I'm glad that the last was a new pair of wings!
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] Yes! And also, I'm glad you've got wings!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is amazing! I didn't know if you'd ever get wings. I'm so happy for you. Does it have something to do with this molt you were talking about?
:'''Spike''': [sighs] It's what's been going on with me. The breakout, the fire burps. The molt is when dragons get older and start to change. I wish I could stop it, but I can't. I-I should go.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Go? What are you talking about?
:'''Spike''': In the Dragon Lands, families make molters leave home. It's called the molt effect.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, this isn't the Dragon Lands, and molt effect or no, I don't want you going anywhere.
:'''Spike''': But I'm growing up. What if something even worse happens?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're supposed to grow up, but you'll always be you. And whatever happens, we'll get through it together.
:'''Spike''': Woo-hoo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Look at me! Let's go home!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, I don't need to carry you anymore, do I? You have wings.
:'''Spike''': They are new, and I don't want to overdo it.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]

:'''Rarity''': I can't believe you thought any of us would send you away because of some silly molt effect. [sighs] Even if the symptoms were slightly unsettling. And let's face it, the odor wasn't pleasant. Nopony would stop caring for you just because you were getting older. Everypony goes through changes, but sometimes change can be wonderful. Like being able to model for any length of dress! [giggles] Uh, a bit higher, darling, please?
:'''Spike''': I'm glad to help, Rarity. But don't you think there's wonderful things about flying that don't involve dresses?
:'''Rarity''': Of course, darling. Flying will also be beneficial for you to help me with gowns, frocks, robes, shifts, skirts, minis, maxis... [fades out]
:'''Spike''': [sighs]

:'''Scootaloo''': Almost... there...
:'''Apple Bloom''': Ah! I can't wait! Twilight's school is supposed to be amazin' inside!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [whispering] Rarity says there's never been a school like it!
:'''Scootaloo''': [grunting] I heard the students get to do ''tons'' of awesome stuff!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Do ya see anything yet?
:'''Scootaloo''': Uh, yeah. It looks like a broom! And a dustpan and some buckets.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That sounds like a closet.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Try another window.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whooooo's ready for cupcakes?!
:[music]
:'''Gallus''': [slurps]

:'''Students''': [laughter]
:'''Applejack''': That's friendship in action, y'all!
:'''Students''': [excited chatter]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Wow! And I thought ''our'' school was fun!
:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah! Miss Cheerilee never lets ''us'' play buckball in class. I know. I've tried.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Hey! Why don't we go here instead? It's still school, right?
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheering] Great idea!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [sighs] What could be better than learnin' friendship with your best friends?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Learning friendship with your best friends... and cake! [munches]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [giggling]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[indistinct chatter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [clears throat] Good morning, class. Today, we're going to learn about friendship through the ages. Spike, slide one, please.
:[slide projector turns on]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Back in the days of Chancellor Puddinghead... Uh, Spike?
:'''Spike''': Huh? Sorry, Twilight. Still getting used to my new wings. They're pretty great, huh?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, Spike. As I was saying... Huh? What are you three doing here?
:'''Apple Bloom''': We wanna go to your school!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But why?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We wanna learn friendship!
:'''Scootaloo''': And play buckball!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I see. Why don't you three come with me? Spike, you're in charge.
:'''Spike''': Yes!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hi, Twilight! Looks like you could use a guidance counselor's help! Hint, hint.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, thanks, Starlight. I've got this.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sadly] Great. Well, I'll just... go dust my office for the seventieth time.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but... you can't be my students.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Why not?
:'''Scootaloo''': Isn't this place for ''every''creature?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Yes, but we teach ''friendship'' lessons here. You already know all about helping ponies in need and being there for each other.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Can't you just give us a chance?
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Pleeeeeeeeeeeaaaase?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You need Cheerilee's classes, not mine. Hurry up. You don't want late marks on your permanent record.
:[door opens]
:'''Students''': ''O dragon! My dragon!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike?! What did you do?
:'''Spike''': [laughs nervously]
:[door closes]

:'''Scootaloo''': [sighs] Well, ''I'm'' not giving up! I know we can prove we belong in this school!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Yeah! Um... how?
:'''Apple Bloom''': By showin' Twilight we've still got lots to learn about friendship. And I know just where to start.

:[squish]
:'''Applejack''': [grunts] What in tarnation? Apple Bloom! You know better than to leave our good tools out like that! And aren't you supposed to be on harvest duty right now?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Eh, it's not like the apples are goin' anywhere.
:'''Applejack''': [stammering] What's gotten into you? Those chores are ''your'' responsibility! Farm work is family work!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Sorry, Applejack. Maybe if I went to Twilight's school, I'd learn to be better at helpin' the family.
:'''Applejack''': Ahhh. So ''that's'' what this is all about. Well, if it's learnin' you want, I'd be happy to give you a private lesson right now... [angrily] Startin' with cleanin' up all this equipment!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Hmph!

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Please can I go to Twilight's school?!
:'''Rarity''': [screams, sighs, sighs again]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Please? Please?!
:'''Rarity''': I'm going to call you "Repeatie Belle"! We've been through this! Please let me concentrate! [sighs]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': How 'bout now?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': So there I was, leading the Wonderbolt formation into a super dangerous Sundown Spiral, when suddenly... [imitates whooshing] There was a huge storm cloud in our way!
:'''"Citrine Spark"''': What happened?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': My genius happened! I changed the routine on the fly! And because my crew are such tight friends, they followed me!
:'''"Berry Bliss"''': [gasps] What did you do?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Only the coolest thing ever! I flew up and—
:'''Scootaloo''': Did a super-amazing half-twist into a backflip sonic rainboom?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey! I never told ''that'' story to my students before. Scootaloo!
:'''Scootaloo''': [laughs nervously] Never met her. [sighs]

:[ponies chattering]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': They're coming! Get ready!
:[scooting]
:[whirrs]
:'''Scootaloo''': Look out!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [stiltedly] Look out! Whoa!
:'''Scootaloo''': [grunts]
:[thudding]
:'''Scootaloo''': [stiltedly] Hey! Watch where you are going!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [stiltedly] I ''was'' watching! Watching ''you'' drive like a crazy pony!
:'''Scootaloo''': [stiltedly] Well, maybe if you did not drop apples all over the street, I would not have to!
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh. I've never seen Apple Bloom and Scootaloo argue like this.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah. They usually go together like candy canes and stripes.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Whoa! Oof!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [stiltedly] ''My'' apples? This is all ''your'' fault, Scootaloo!
:'''Scootaloo''': [stiltedly] Hey, Sweetie Belle is the clumsy one!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [stiltedly] I'm not talking to either one of you ever again!
:'''Fluttershy''': Goodness. They seem really upset.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': It's almost like they forgot they're friends.
:'''Scootaloo''': [quietly] I think it's working!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [stiltedly] You are so careless! [quietly] Good plan, Apple Bloom!
:'''Apple Bloom''': [stiltedly] Careless? I will show ''you'' who is the one who is careless! [quietly] And great acting, Sweetie Belle!
:'''Scootaloo''': [out loud] We're an awesome team!
:'''Apple Bloom''': All right!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yay!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Oops.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're friends again! I knew you would be! Candy cane stripes forever!
:[party cannon squeak]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [sighs]
:'''Scootaloo''': Now they'll ''never'' let us into Twilight's school.

:'''Apple Bloom''': Okay, we've tried shirkin' chores, pesterin', disguises, fightin'.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Hmmm... We need to do something new. Something unexpected.
:[muffled crying]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Great idea, Scootaloo! We haven't tried cryin' yet.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Yeah! It always works for Rarity.
:'''Scootaloo''': ''I'' wasn't crying. I think it's coming from outside.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [crying]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Aww. She looks so sad. We better go see what's wrong.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [continues crying]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Hey. Are you okay?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh. Thank you for asking. But no. I'm having real trouble with... [sniffling] ...the School of Friendship.
:'''Scootaloo''': Twilight won't let ''you'' go either, huh?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, no, it's not that. I'm in her class, but... [sniffling] ...it's too hard! [crying]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Really?
:'''Cozy Glow''': I just moved here to go to school, but everything's so new and different. I don't know anypony.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, now you do. I'm Apple Bloom. This is Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo. We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [sniffs] I'm Cozy Glow. It's very nice to meet you, but I don't know if I'll stay long. I'll probably flunk out. I'm having so much trouble with my friendship lessons.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [gasps]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We can help with those!
:'''Scootaloo''': We know all about friendship!
:'''Apple Bloom''': And studyin' with you would be almost as good as bein' in class!
:'''Cozy Glow''': But why would you help ''me''? What's in it for ''you''?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': That's how friendship works. When you give from your heart, you don't expect anything back.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Well, golly, if you really mean it...
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Uh-huh!
:'''Cozy Glow''': I could use some help with my homework. I have to do something nice for each of these ponies. But I don't know anything about them. And it's so hard to talk to ponies you've never met.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, you're in luck, 'cause we know all of those ponies!
:'''Scootaloo''': Get ready for a friendship A-plus!

:[zoom!]
:'''Scootaloo''': That's Bon Bon. If you wanna do something nice for her, first you gotta figure out what she needs.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Well, how am I supposed to do that?
:'''Scootaloo''': Just pay attention. Friendship is about listening to others.
:'''Sweetie Drops''': Ow. Ow.
:'''Scootaloo''': Uh-oh. That cactus keeps pricking her every step she takes. Hmm, if only there was something to protect her from those spines.
:'''Sweetie Drops''': [winces]
:'''Cozy Glow''': It looks like you need help carrying your cactus, so here's a safe way to take it home. [laughs nervously]
:'''Sweetie Drops''': Thank you! That's so thoughtful.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I did it!
:'''Scootaloo''': Good job! But, uh, next time, maybe don't give away my helmet.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oopsie.

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Green, purple, yellow. And one more purple. Whew. Sorting all those took longer than I thought.
:'''Cozy Glow''': You really think Mrs. Cake will like these new sprinkle shakers?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Mm-hmm. Now she won't have to use ''rainbow'' sprinkles all the time. She can just pick the color she wants!
:[bell ringing]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Ooh! I'm sorry, I was out to lunch. Were you fillies waiting for me long?
:'''Cozy Glow''': No. Um, these are for you!
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Oh, well, what a lovely surprise! I can't wait to try them out!
:[sprinkles shaking]
:'''Mrs. Cake''': Look! I made rainbow sprinkles! Aren't they wonderful?
:'''Cozy Glow''': But... she... I... [groans]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': At least she likes her present?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Uh-huh...

:[thuds]
:[whistling]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Golly. How'd you know that would make him so happy?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Friendship means pitchin' in to help others' chores go faster. 'Specially when their special somepony's waitin' for 'em.

:[school bell ringing]
:[students chattering and laughing]
:'''Scootaloo''': [groans] That class was ''so'' boring!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Not even Miss Cheerilee can make the history of radishes exciting.
:'''Apple Bloom''': I bet they don't have to learn about that stuff at Twilight's school.
:[zoom!]
:[crash!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Guess what! I got an A on my homework!
:'''Scootaloo''': [cheers]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Nice goin'!
:'''Cozy Glow''': And I never could have done it without ''your'' help!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': No problem!
:'''Scootaloo''': We just wish we could have done more.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Actually, you ''can''. Headmare Twilight is giving us a ''big'' test at the end of the week, and I could really use your help studying.
:'''Apple Bloom''': We wanted to go to Twilight's school more than anything. But helpin' you has been even more fun! You can count on us!

:[montage music]
:[Angel munching]
:[magic noises]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Um... intelligence?

:[magic noises]
:[clattering]
:'''Sweetie Belle''' and '''Apple Bloom''': [laughing]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [giggles]

:[music continues]
:'''Apple Bloom''' and '''Cozy Glow''': [giggling]

:'''Cozy Glow''': Laughter?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Yes!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Is it... control?

:[wind blowing]
:[bushes rustling]

:'''Cozy Glow''': Kindness! Loyalty! Honesty! Generosity! Laughter! Magic!
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''' and '''Cozy Glow''': [cheering]

:[students laughing]
:'''Apple Bloom''': How'd the test go?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Were there essay questions?
:'''Scootaloo''': Did you remember what we taught you?
:'''Cozy Glow''': I... ''failed''! [crying]
:'''Apple Bloom''': But how could Cozy Glow fail her friendship test?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ahem. I'd like to see you three in my office!

:'''Scootaloo''': [quietly] I know we wanted to be invited inside, but it kinda went different in my head.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe you'd do something like this!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Like what?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You ''are'' Cozy Glow's tutors, aren't you?
:'''Scootaloo''': We've been working with her for days!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's what she told me. So you've been setting her up to ''fail''?
{|
|
:'''Sweetie Belle''' and '''Scootaloo''': What?!
|
:'''Apple Bloom''': How?!
|}
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know you're upset that I won't let you come to my school, but to teach Cozy all the wrong things out of spite... That's just cruel!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': But we taught her all the ''right'' things!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then how do you explain these friendship test answers? [reading] "What are the six Elements of Harmony?" Five turtlenecks and a cheese grater? "Who is the Princess of Friendship?" Your mom?
:'''Apple Bloom''': I... I don't understand.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Me neither. I never thought you three would pull such a mean prank. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to stay away from my school. ''And'' my students.
:[door closes]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, no!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hmm? [dryly] Yay. Now I'll alphabetize them in reverse order. [sighs] Not much need for a guidance counselor at a school of friendship.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [clearing throat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Aah!
:[thud]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': How much of that did you hear?! Uh, never mind.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs nervously] Welcome! Can I get you a comfort pillow? Security blanket? Empathy cocoa?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Uh, I just need some advice.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh! Well, I have plenty of that! Anecdotes, insight, midnight confessions... I'm babbling. [clears throat] Go ahead. I'm listening.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I think I got my friends in trouble. They helped me study for my friendship test, and I failed it... on purpose.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Why would you do that? Uh, sorry. Listening. [sips cocoa]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Well, the Cutie Mark Crusaders wanted to go to this school more than anything. So I thought if I showed Headmare Twilight they're bad at friendship, she'd let them come here with me.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's devious. I-I mean, I see. [sips cocoa]
:'''Cozy Glow''': I guess I still have a lot to learn about friendship.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Actually, I think you're doing all right. Sure, that was a really, really bad way to try to help your friends, but what matters is you wanted to. The reason the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't go to this school is because they'd make better teachers than students.
:'''Cozy Glow''': So you ''do'' have a place for them here?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hmmm...

:[students chattering]
:[scraping]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [groans] I bet there's no "Wonderful World of Cleaning" lesson at Twilight's school.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [coughs] We'll never find out now.
:'''Scootaloo''': [sighs] I still don't get how Cozy failed her test after all that studying.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Or how Twilight could blame us for it!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Or how gum can be so sticky!
:[knock on door]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sorry to interrupt, Miss Cheerilee. But can I borrow Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?

:[ominous music]
:'''Scootaloo''': We didn't do anything wrong! We promise!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know that. Now. Which is why I wanted to talk to you.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Wait. So we're not in trouble?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Just the opposite. Cozy Glow, is there something you'd like to say?
:'''Cozy Glow''': This is all my fault. I messed up my test on purpose so we could all go to school together. I'm sorry.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you, Cozy Glow. Honesty is one of the pillars of friendship. [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] But ''you'' already know that. Which is why I'd like to give you these.
:[thud]
:'''Spike''': [groans]
:'''Applejack''': They're honorary diplomas, makin' y'all official graduates of this here school.
:'''Rarity''': You've more than earned them.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Without even having to study!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [cheering]
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [chanting] We are graduates! We are graduates! We are graduates!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And if you're interested, I think Starlight has a place for you at my school after all.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': Woo-hoo!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We could use some friendship tutors on staff. And I hear you're the best out there.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Then what are we waitin' for? Let's get tutorin'! Come on, Cozy!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And that's why this school needs ''you'' as our guidance counselor.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''' and '''Cozy Glow''': [laughing]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] I've been planning this retreat for weeks, and we're already ten minutes behind! Where is that photographer?!
:'''Photographer''': ...No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
:[doors open]
:'''Photographer''': I'm so sorry! Can you forgive me? I don't expect you to forgive me... Forgive me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Of course. I'll help you set up your—
:'''Photographer''': Princess Twilight, thanks so much for this! The Canterlot Historical Society is thrilled to document the friendship work your teachers do! Let me just pretty you all up!
:[poink!]
:'''Photographer''': Ooh!
:[poink!]
:[poink!]
:'''Photographer''': [giggles] Ooh!
:[poink!]
:[poink!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ow! Hey!
:'''Photographer''': Don't want a single hair out of place, do we? This is for the history books! Now...
:[camera flashing]
:'''Photographer''': Well, that's that! Bye!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Waaaait! You forgot Starlight! She needs a picture, too!
:'''Photographer''': 'Kay.
:[camera flashing]
:'''Photographer''': Now I'll get out of your manes. I know how busy you are.

:'''Photographer''': Now I have everything I need.
:[transformation noise]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [maniacal laughter]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Yes, I know! We ''have'' been planning this for quite some time. [laughing evilly] Oh, thank you, Applejack. My spell can create a copy of anypony I desire. All I need is an image and a piece of the pony. [sniffs] Oh, and this.
:[magic zap]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Why copies, Rarity? Because Princess Twilight and her friends control the Elements of Harmony, the most powerful weapon in all Equestria.
:[magic zap]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Which means you - will - be - able - to - use - them - too!
:[magic zap]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': And serve me!
:[magic zap]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Together, we will destroy Twilight Sparkle and her meddlesome friends!
:[magic zap]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Of course I haven't forgotten Starlight Glimmer! She stole my hive. Turned my subjects against me! So I'll take her friends away while she watches! And then, I'll destroy her! [maniacal laughter]
:[magic zap]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': With the Elements under my control, I'll build a new hive of Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi, and I will rule as Queen once again!
:[magic sounds]
:[cracking]
:[magic sounds]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm. At least our retreat isn't ''too'' far behind schedule. Get ready for fun!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Are we talking ''fun'' fun, or learning pretending to be fun?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Both! We've all been so busy teaching, we've hardly had a chance to hang out with each other. And I may have scheduled some friendship activities as well!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Count me in! We can do friendship trust falls and pony pyramids! Oh! And hide and seek! Quick! Find me!
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, I love the idea of some quiet time with my best friends.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [screams] You found me!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rarity, why is Applejack carrying all your stuff?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, that's not mine. Yes, I ''used'' to overpack a tad, but now it's just the essentials for me. I'm a simple filly.
:'''Applejack''': Normally I wouldn't lug so much gear, but did y'all know this is Starlight's first time campin'?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I just never really felt the need to... "hang out" in nature.
:[insects buzzing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Home has books, tea, fewer bugs, a roof...
:'''Applejack''': That attitude right there is why I brought the whole kit and caboodle. I'm givin' Starlight the full Apple family campin' experience!
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, where ''are'' we camping?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right next to the Elements that brought us all together in the first place – the Tree of Harmony!

:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Listen to your queen! We must retrieve the Elements of Harmony!
:'''Mean Pinkie Pie''': Hunting down some lame Elements? This is the worst day ever!
:'''Mean Fluttershy''': No. ''Now'' it's the worst day ever! [laughing cruelly]
:'''Mean Rarity''': Those Elements are mine! Along with this rock! Oh, and that twig!
:'''Mean Applejack''': I got all ''kinds'' o' Elements right here under my hat. I'll let you see 'em for five bits.
:'''Mean Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Losers.
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Why didn't you just attack them?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Excuse me?
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': You were close enough to pull hairs from their manes. Why not just take your revenge then?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': They've defeated my army. I know better than to strike alone. I need—
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Friends?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': ''Servants!'' And the power of the Elements!
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Right. So where ''are'' these Elements of Harmony?
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': The location of the most powerful weapon in Equestria isn't something made known to just anypony. I learned they were hidden somewhere in this forest.
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Yeah, well, it is a ''big'' forest.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [growling]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Everypony, stop! And smell these roses! [sniffs] Ahhh! Oh, yeah!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [nervous giggle] Right. Roses. Fun. Now, let’s try and stay on schedule.
:'''Rarity''': Applejack, darling, anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?
:'''Applejack''': Uh, let's see here. Uh... all right. I got a bandana!
:'''Rarity''': Ugh, an entire wagon and no anti-frizz? Darling, you're not even prepared.
:'''Applejack''': I am! For campin'? How ya doin', Starlight?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whoa! Ugh. [flatly] Great.
:'''Bird 1''': [tweeting]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, no! You and your sister fell out of your nest and got separated? That's terrible! Here. I'm sure your home isn't too far away.
:[swing creaking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [yelps] Pinkie! If we keep stopping to have fun, we're never gonna get to the fun things ''I've'' got planned!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] Good point! Last one to the Tree of Harmony is a parasprite! Whoo-hoo!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]

:[thud]
:'''Mean Pinkie Pie''': I'm sooooo bored. Are we there yet?
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': ''Where'' yet? We don't even know where we're going!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': The quicker we search the forest, the quicker we find the Elements.
:'''Mean Applejack''': ''I'' know where the Elements are. This, uh, here boulder just told me. I swear.
:'''Bird 2''': [tweeting]
:'''Mean Fluttershy''': You tried to fly out of the nest, but you fell and got lost?
:'''Bird 2''': [tweeting]
:'''Mean Fluttershy''': [laughing cruelly] Hope you like walking! [laughing cruelly]
:'''Mean Rainbow Dash''': [yawns] Come get me when I should care.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Where... are... the others?!
:'''Mean Applejack''': Uh... A, uh, a bugbear in... plaid socks flew down and, uh, g-grabbed them! Then disappeared! Huh. Craziest thing I ever did see!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Turn around. We're going back.
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': No. Keep searching. I'll find the others. We can accomplish more if we split our resources.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Very well. You have my permission.
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': "Permission"? You need us way more than we need you, ''your Majesty''! The others are fools. But with me to lead them, there's no reason we can't find the Elements and keep the power for ourselves!

:[rustling]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You're it! Hey, how'd you get ahead of me? You're fast.
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Ugh! I'm looking for Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Aren't they back there?
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': They are?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sure! Unless they're already at the Tree of Harmony.
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': What is the ''Tree'' of Harmony?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh-ho-ho. This is one of your "activities", right? Like a friendship quiz? It's the crystal tree that holds the Elements of Harmony. Boom!
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Where is it?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [imitates buzzer] It's at the bottom of the stairs in the ravine by the Castle of the Two Sisters. Double boom!
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': How do you know? You've seen it?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mm-hmm. Honestly, Twilight, these questions are super easy.

:'''Bird 1''': [tweeting]
:'''Fluttershy''': Right where you belong.
:'''Bird 1''': [tweets]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, dear. This isn't where ''I'' belong. Oh, Rainbow Dash! I'm so glad you're here. I was lost.
:'''Mean Rainbow Dash''': Bummer. Later.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': What just happened?

:'''Applejack''', '''Rarity''', '''Rainbow Dash''', and '''Starlight Glimmer''': [overlapping] Fluttershy!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, fantastic. First Pinkie races ahead of us, and now Fluttershy's lost somewhere behind us. My retreat is off to a ''great'' start!
:'''Rarity''': It's not like Fluttershy to disappear like this.
:'''Applejack''': We'll split up and search for her. We can all meet back at the Tree. Starlight, take the navigation gear and—
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [quickly] Go with Rarity? Great! Rainbow Dash, you can go with Applejack! [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'll find Pinkie Pie.

:'''Mean Pinkie Pie''': Bored. Bored. Bored.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': This is ridiculous! Where are my other minions?!
:'''Mean Rarity''': Probably plotting to steal ''my'' things! [growls]
:'''Mean Applejack''': They're at a secret party up in that there tree. Run by a... squirrel named, uh, Jerome. But, uh, y-you need a password to get in.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [growls] Enough!
:[thud]
:[slam!]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': You will go out there and find the others, you will bring them back here, and we will steal the Elements of Harmony so I can destroy Starlight's life like she destroyed mine! [through gritted teeth] ''Understand?''
:'''Mean Rarity''', '''Mean Applejack''', and '''Mean Pinkie Pie''': [nervously] Uh-huh!
:'''Mean Applejack''': The party password is "rutabaga".

:'''Mean Fluttershy''': [mockingly] Why don't you fly up to your nest? Oh, that's right. You can't! [laughing cruelly]
:'''Bird 1''': [tweeting]
:'''Mean Fluttershy''': Oh. Nopony asked ''you''. I hope you all ''freeze'' this winter!
:[mice squeaking]
:'''Mean Fluttershy''': [laughing cruelly]
:'''Fluttershy''': Hello again, little friend. I think I may be walking in circles.
:'''Bird 1''': [tweeting angrily]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Oh, my! Where did you learn that kind of language? Um, excuse me?
:[animals growling and chittering angrily]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpering]

:'''Mean Rarity''': Finally, you found her!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Me? We're looking for Fluttershy!
:'''Applejack''': Where's Starlight?
:'''Mean Rarity''': Well, if I knew that—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts] Hey!
:'''Mean Rarity''': This is mine! And this as well! Oh, and this is ''absolutely'' mine!
:'''Applejack''': Rarity, what in the hay are ''you'' gonna do with a fishin' rod?
:'''Mean Rarity''': I don't know. But I ''wants'' it! [snorts]

:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Starlight, darling, you're a gloriously bad camper. And coming from me, that is saying a lot.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know. Want to break it to Applejack for me?
:[rustle]
:'''Mean Applejack''': Who's breakin' what now?
:[thud]
:'''Mean Applejack''': Who are ''you''?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Very funny, Applejack. Still me under all this gear. Starlight.
:'''Mean Applejack''': Starlight? How 'bout that? Y'all better come with me. It's, uh, dangerous out here.
:'''Rarity''': Applejack, darling, are you all right? You look a little peaky. And where's your wagon?
:'''Mean Applejack''': Uh... stolen! Uh, I barely got away! Follow me, and I'll tell ya all about it.
:[clattering]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie! There you are! What are you doing?
:[pop!]
:'''Mean Pinkie Pie''': You call that a pop?! Ugh!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I thought you were racing to the retreat.
:'''Mean Pinkie Pie''': Please. Why would I waste my time on a boring, lame, no-fun retreat?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What? Rainbow Dash! I think something's wrong with Pinkie!
:'''Mean Rainbow Dash''': Not my problem.
:[splash!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans]
:[pop!]

:'''Pinkie Pie''': And then we all grew super-long manes with all kinds of colors, and your castle grew out of the ground, and everypony was like, "Whoa!" And then we sang this song about rainbows, and— [gasps]
:'''Fluttershy''': [crying]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Fluttershy! What's wrong?
:'''Fluttershy''': [crying] Everycreature is mad at me!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps] What?! That can't be right!
:'''Fluttershy''': [crying, sniffling]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] Can we hurry this up? We're on a schedule here!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight, your schedule can wait! Fluttershy's upset.
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Well, tell her to get over it! I'll go get the others. Stay here!
:'''Fluttershy''': [crying, sniffling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, great. You upset Fluttershy, too?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You know what, Twilight? Maybe if you weren't so worried about schedules, you'd realize ''you're'' the one ruining the retreat for your friends!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Well, if my friends don't care about the retreat I planned for them... maybe they should've stayed home!
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Can't we all just get along?!'' [crying]

:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Keep it together. You can do this. You need those imbeciles if your plan is gonna come together.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': ''Your'' plan?
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Uh, ''the'' plan. I'm just trying to do your bidding, your Majesty.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Grub-sitting you six is nothing like controlling my hive! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just destroy you all and start over!
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Because I know where the Elements of Harmony are. You need me.
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': [maniacal laughter]

:'''Mean Rarity''': ''Mine''. Mine! [crazed laughter] All mine!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [to Applejack] I'm guessing some kind of curse? Maybe poison joke?
:'''Applejack''': Well, somethin' sure ain't right.
:'''Mean Rarity''': What are you plotting back there? I can hear you, you know! Don't think you're going to steal my things! [panting, spluttering]
:'''Applejack''': Hang on. I got a shovel we can use to whack those vines out of the way.
:'''Mean Rarity''': [grunting] ''I knew it!'' I knew you wanted it all for yourselves! You can't have it!
:[thud]
:'''Mean Rarity''': It's mine, you hear me?! All ''mi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hine!'' [crazed laughter]

:'''Mean Applejack''': ...So there I was. Just me and, uh, a bucket of honey. Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket. Uh, b-but I-I survived all by myself in this here forest for, uh, a hundred and... twenty-seven hours!
:'''Rarity''': Really? I can't believe you've never told us that story before.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': She's making a point. We get it. You're the greatest camper in the history of Equestria.
:'''Mean Applejack''': Well, I sure don't need any o' that silly stuff ''you're'' luggin' around.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, the things ''you'' gave me are silly?!
:'''Mean Applejack''': [chuckles] Just look in a mirror. Guess I should've told you that before, huh? [chuckling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps, tearing up] Glad I was so entertaining for you!
:'''Rarity''': [to Mean Applejack] I'm going to make sure that she doesn't break a hoof out there, and then you and I are going to have a serious talk!
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Finally! There. That's all of you. Nopony leaves without my say-so.
:'''Mean Applejack''': Now, wait a second. Weren't you just—?
:[magic zap]
:'''Mean Applejack''': [gulps]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': The time for my revenge on Starlight Glimmer has come! Let's see if you're telling the truth about this Tree. [maniacal laughter]

:'''Rarity''': Starlight! Oh! Please stop running!
:[screech]
:'''Rarity''': [yelps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Ugh!
:'''Rarity''' and '''Starlight Glimmer''': Whoa!
:[crash!]
:'''Fluttershy''': [crying]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course I care about Fluttershy!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Then you've got a super weird way of showing it!
:'''Rarity''': W-What in Equestria's going on here?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Twilight is so into her ''retreat'' that she doesn't even care if her friends are upset! She just wants us to "stay on schedule"!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I'm sorry, Pinkie! If I knew you thought this was a "boring, lame, no-fun retreat", I wouldn't have invited you in the first place!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''I never said that!''
:'''Applejack''': Sorry, y'all. We would've been here sooner, but we had to take the long way after Rarity ran off with all my stuff.
:'''Rarity''': Wha—?! I most certainly did not!
:'''Applejack''': What?! You know I ain't no liar! [to Starlight Glimmer] Where's all your gear?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Why? So you can laugh at me some more?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey, hey, we're all friends here!
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Friends?!'' You left me alone in the woods! [crying]
:[main cast except Twilight arguing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Everypony, quiet! Listen. We know each other really well — the great stuff and how to get on each other's nerves, too. I wanted a fun trip with my friends. But instead, I got carried away with plans and ruined everything. If you want to forget it all and head home, I won't be offended. I just want us to stop fighting.
:'''Applejack''': [to Starlight Glimmer] Hey, sorry if I got carried away with all that campin' stuff.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm sorry, too. I should've just told you I'll never like camping. Also, I'll never like camping.
:'''Rarity''': Well, if we're all being honest, I can't survive with just this tiny yet fashionable little saddlebag! I miss my things!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [to Twilight Sparkle] I'm sorry that you thought that I thought your plan was lame. Your plans are the most un-lamest!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And I always have fun when we're all together. Even if it's learning pretending to be fun.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So... does that mean you still want to have the retreat?
:'''All except Twilight Sparkle and Fluttershy''': Yes!
:'''Fluttershy''': If everypony likes me again.
:'''All''': [laughing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's get to that Tree. I have the whole campsite set up and ready.

:'''Mean Pinkie Pie''': [groans] What's this garbage?
:'''Mean Applejack''': Badger installation art! Ya see—
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': ''Just! Retrieve! The Elements!''
:'''Mean Fluttershy''': [laughing cruelly]
:'''Mean Rarity''': Mine! Mine!
:[clattering]
:'''Mean Rarity''': Mine! [crazed laughter]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Once we get the power of the Elements, no creature – not even her Majesty – can tell us what to do. Just follow my lead. Got it?
:'''Mean Ponies''': [laughing evilly]
:'''Mean Rarity''': Ooh! That one's mine!
:[ping!]
:'''Mean Rarity''': [crazed laughter]
:[thud]
:'''Mean Fluttershy''': Oops. I'd say sorry, but I'm not!
:'''Mean Rarity''' and '''Mean Fluttershy''': [grunting]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Stop it, fools!
:[ping!]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': We need the Elements to take out Chrysalis! [gasps]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': How dare you! I created you!
:[magic zap]
:[thud]
:[dull pulsating]
:[ping!]
:'''Mean Pinkie Pie''': [laughing]
:[ping!]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': [groaning]
:[ping!]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': [groaning]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]
:[magic sounds]
:'''Mean Twilight Sparkle''': Imbeciles! You ruined everythiiiiiiiing!
:[shimmering sounds]
:[clattering]
:'''Queen Chrysalis''': Servants always fail you in the end! Just wait, Starlight. I will have my revenge!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps] Are you kidding me?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [laughing] This was... the worst... day... ever!
:'''All''': [laughing]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Come on, everypony. We can fix this campsite in no time.
:'''Applejack''': Spoken like a true camper.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Eh, don't push it.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Starlight Glimmer''': [chuckling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You know, if we can survive a day like this, I think our friendship is strong enough to handle anything the world can throw at us.

:[chest opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Who can tell me what these are?
:'''Sandbar''': Whoa...
:'''Gallus''': Me likey...
:'''Yona''': Shiny!
:'''Smolder''': Treasure?
:'''Ocellus''': Nope! They're all legendary magical artifacts!
:[beat]
:'''Ocellus''': Heh-heh. I've read ahead in ''Equestrian Cultures and Camaraderie: Volume Seven''.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're right, Ocellus. This is the Amulet of Aurora, the Talisman of Mirage, the Helm of Yksler, the Crown of Grover, Knuckerbocker's Shell, and Clover the Clever's Cloak.
:'''Spike''': And the gems are real! Eh, not that I... tasted them.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Princess Celestia gifted these to our school, since they each represent one of the cultures our students come from. And we'll learn all about them in a Spell-venger Hunt!
:[beat]
:'''Smolder''': [aside, to Sandbar] Is that a pony thing?
:'''Sandbar''': Eh.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's a magical scavenger hunt. Each of you will work in pairs to try to find where in the school these artifacts are hidden.
:'''Spike''': The team that finds the most wins a private tour of the Canterlot Archives with Princess Celestia.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggles]
:'''Silverstream''': [excited squeal] Learning ''and'' fun?! Does it get any better than that?!
:'''Gallus''': You've been underwater a long time, haven't you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Gallus and Silverstream, sounds like you're our first pair!
:'''Students''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What? They'll make a great team.
:[cutie mark glowing]
:'''Yona''': Um, why pony glowing?

:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait. You all were called on this friendship quest, too?
:'''Fluttershy''': It must be a really important one.
:'''Rarity''': And terribly far away.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Just getting there will take days!
:'''Applejack''': Do y'all know what this means? There won't be any teachers left to run the school!
:'''Mane Six except Applejack''': [gasp]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Fluttershy''': Should we send our students home?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I say we take 'em with us! Road trip!
:'''Rarity''': In the middle of my friendship quilting class? I think not! All of those unfinished seams! [faints]
:'''Applejack''': Problem is we don't even know how long we'll be gone.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Don't worry, everypony. I already have a seventy-point plan in place for this very situation.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You want ''me'' to be headmare?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're the ''perfect'' choice! You're a good leader and an expert in friendship. I trust you to run this school exactly as I would.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, that's a pretty big responsibility, Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Which is why I've prepared everything you need.
:[bell ringing]
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The curriculum, rules for the Spell-venger Hunt, dining hall menus for the next six months...
:'''Spike''': Six ''months''?! You're not ''really'' gonna be gone ''that'' long, are you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...and Spike. Anything that isn't covered in my files, he'll be able to help you with.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Then why not put ''him'' in charge?
:'''Spike''': No-ho-ho, thanks. Eh, being a princess for Twilight was hard enough.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm gonna pretend that made sense. But if you're sure it's what you really want, I promise I won't let you down.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I ''knew'' I could count on you.
:[door closes]
:'''Spike''': [yells]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Great. What could possibly go wrong?

:[galloping]
:'''Spike''': Goodbye, Rarity! A-And everypony!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Come back soon! Please!
:'''Discord''': [blows nose]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Huh?
:'''Discord''': [through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces.
:[pop!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Discord! What a... heh... nice surprise! This is your first time at our new school, isn't it?
:'''Discord 1''': Oh, was I not invited to the grand opening?
:'''Discord 2''': Friends and Family Day?
:'''Discord 3''': Baccalaureate?
:'''All three Discords''':  I hadn't noticed.
:[flash]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, at least you're here now. Um, why ''are'' you here now?
:'''Discord''': To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?
:'''Spike''': Then you ''also'' must've heard Starlight is in charge now.
:'''Discord''': Really? I thought there must be some mistake.
:[flick]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Nope. Twilight picked me for the job. And she left pretty detailed instructions for me to follow.
:'''Discord''': Well, I'm sure that she wouldn't mind a few tiny suggestions. [snaps fingers]
:[flash]
:'''Discord''': [writing] "Item one – Gravity is optional."
:[warbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Whoa-oa!
:'''Discord''': "Item two – The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset."
:[marmoset mascot squeaks]
:'''Discord''': "Item three—"
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Not gonna happen. I promised Twilight I'd handle this her way. So thanks, but no thanks.
:'''Discord''': Reeeeeeally? Well, we'll see if you change your mind. [snaps fingers]
:[flash]
:[splash]
:'''Spike''': Uh-oh. When we play ''Ogres & Oubliettes'' and he puts that many E's in "really", the things don't usually end well.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Don't worry, Spike. Discord and I are old "save Equestria" buddies. He'll be fine. Now, what's next on Twilight's list?
:[door opens]

:'''Spike''': Okay. I hid the artifacts for the Spell-venger Hunt and ordered school supplies for the week. All you have to worry about is teaching class.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Thanks, Spike. Maybe we ''will'' get through this okay.
:[doors open]
:[peacocks call]
:[Castle Thunder]<!--That is the official name of the stock sound effect, don't change-->
:[typewriter clicking]
:'''Discord''': Come in, come in. You'll let the twittermites out. [munches]
:'''Spike''': Twittermites?
:[swarming]
:'''Spike''': Ow!
:[splash]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Discord! What are you doing?!
:'''Spike''': [gasps for air]
:'''Discord''': Nopony was at your desk. Imagine what Twilight would say. [imitating Twilight] Oh, how could you, Starlight?! You've broken my trust and failed me completely! [normal voice] Oh, don't worry. I'll cover for you. By the way, I hope you like Limburger cheese. I got a month's supply for the teacher's lounge. [snaps fingers]
:[flash]
:[crate opening]
:'''Spike''': [screams]
:[squish!]
:'''Spike''': [sniffs, gags]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gags] We'll take it from here, Discord. Go relax. Have a cup of tea. At home.
:[door stops]
:'''Discord''': Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.
:[splat]
:'''Spike''': Actually, that does sound kinda helpful. And it was next on our to-do list.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Which teachers did you hire?

:[stomp]
:'''Iron Will''': They call it "making friends", because you have to ''make'' creatures be your friends! Show me what you've got, yak!
:'''Yona''': [clears throat, quietly] Be my friend.
:'''Iron Will''': If you're quiet, I don't buy it!
:'''Yona''': [louder] Be my friend!
:'''Iron Will''': I've heard pudding that's more convincing!
:'''Yona''': [huffs, even louder] ''Be! My! Friend!''
:[zip!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [quietly] That's not how Twilight teaches friendship.

:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': Some field trip! Where's my iced tea?! [sips, gulps, spits] This is too cold! [sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too hot!
:[pours]
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': [sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too tea-flavored!
:[clatter]
:'''Cranky Doodle Donkey''': You call yourselves friends?!
:'''Spike''': That is definitely not how Twilight teaches friendship.
:'''Discord''': [sips]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You hired a ''tree'' as a teacher?!
:'''Discord''': Its schedule was free.
:'''Spike''': Uh, guys? That's not just ''any'' tree.
:'''Smolder''': [sneezes]
:'''Students''': [scream]
:'''Spike''': [blows nose] It's a dragon-sneeze tree.
:'''Smolder''': [sneezes]
:'''Students''': [scream]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': W-W-W-Wait! Calm down, everycreature! It's gonna be okay!
:'''Yona''': [yells] ''BE MY FRIEEEEENNNND!''
:'''Discord''': Mmmm, my, my, my. You do seem like you're in over your head. Won't Twilight be so disappointed with how you're ruining—I mean, ''running'' her school?

:'''Students''': [screaming]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Discord!
:'''Discord''': [munching]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': This is all ''your'' fault!
:'''Discord''': ''Mine?'' I thought ''you'' were in charge here. But I'm happy to pitch in if you need me.
:[flash]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What I ''need'' is for you to leave!
:'''Discord''': [snaps fingers]
:[flash]
:'''Discord''': Happy now?
:'''Spike''': Come on, Discord. You know that's not what she means.
:'''Discord''': Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] Thanks, Spike. Let's just hope he stays gone.
:'''Spike''': I wouldn't count on it. I think Discord's trying to test you.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But why? I thought we were friends.
:'''Spike''': Well, it's kinda what he does. Even to ponies or dragons he cares about.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, well, I'm ready for him. I told Twilight I'd run her school right, and I'm gonna keep that promise. No matter what.

:[nighttime ambience]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Good morning, students! I know there's been a little bit of adjustment since the professors left for their trip. But I've brought in ''new'' new teachers. And now everything should run smoothly. Now it's time for class. And don't forget, this afternoon is the Spell-venger Hunt!
:'''Students''': [chattering]

:[door slams open]
:[stock gasp sound]
:'''Discord''': [California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!
:[flash]
:'''Discord''': Is this seat taken?
:'''Ocellus''': [laughs nervously]
:[poof]
:'''Trixie''': Welcome, class! You may call me the Great and Powerful ''Professor'' Trrrrrri—
:[phone ringing]
:'''Discord''': Shhh! Really, that's so inconsiderate!
:[phone ringing]
:[bananaphone ringing]
:'''Discord''': Oh, I better take this. Hello?
:'''Voice on bananaphone''': [garbled sped-up gibberish]
:'''Discord''': Oh, he did not! And what did you say?
:'''Voice on bananaphone''': [garbled sped-up gibberish]
:'''Discord''': [gasps] You did ''not''!
:'''Trixie''': Discord! Why are ''you'' here?!
:'''Discord''': Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me.
:'''Trixie''': Of course I am! No fruit calls in my class!
:[banana peels]
:'''Discord''': [gulps]
:'''Trixie''': Magic is the most important element of friendship. So, today I, the Great and Powerful Trixie, will put on a magic show!
:'''Discord''': [snaps fingers]
:[Pigasus squeals]
:[ursa major roaring]
:'''Students''': [scream]
:'''Discord''': [chuckles] I'm learning ''so'' much. Aren't ''you''?
:'''Trixie''': [growls] ''Discord!''
:[doors close]
:[bananaphone ringing]
:[beep]
:'''Trixie''': Eh, hello?
:'''Voice on bananaphone''': [garbled sped-up gibberish]
:'''Trixie''': Um, what exactly ''is'' a long-distance plan?

:'''Yona''': [pants]
:'''Discord''': Take a lap, team!
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, actually, we just finished Professor Spitfire's workout.
:'''Discord''': Sounds like somepony needs a little motivation. [blows whistle]
:[flash]
:'''Students''': [gasp, scream]
:[bugbear growls]
:'''Silverstream''': I've never run so fast in my life! Oh, this is great!
:'''Sandbar''': [pants] Hey, coach, we need a break.
:'''Discord''': Friendship is about honesty. So believe me when I say... ''we're not stopping!'' [blows whistle]
:'''Sandbar''': [yelps, pants]
:[bugbear growls]
:'''Yona''': [panting] Yona... can't run... faster...! [grunts]
:[bugbear growls]
:[zap!]
:[bugbear whimpers]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Discord, that's enough! Endangering students crosses the line! I don't know ''why'' you're trying to ruin this school, but it stops now!
:[flash]
:'''Discord''': I wouldn't be so sure.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': This is your last warning.
:'''Spike''': Hey-hey-hey! Take it easy, Starlight! Discord's your friend, remember?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, he's not acting like it!
:'''Spike''': [huffs] She's right, Discord. What's your problem?
:'''Discord''': ''My'' problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school ''my problem?!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps, yells]
:[zap!]
:[crackles]
:'''Students''': [shudder]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [nervous laughter] Don't worry. I just banished him from school grounds forever. He's fine.
:'''Spike''': That probably made things worse. Why didn't you just talk to Discord?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Because he's right about ''one'' thing. I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.
:'''Spike''': No, you haven't. Discord is just bein'... Discord.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Maybe. But I wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.
:[school bell rings]
:'''Spike''': We can figure that out ''after'' the Spell-venger Hunt. C'mon!

:[doors open]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': For this afternoon's Spell-venger Hunt, you'll need to use the artifacts' history to find where they're hidden in the castle. When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield to keep track of your score.
:'''Spike''': Twilight left the list of your hunt partners before she left. I'll pass out the shields.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Ready... set... Spell-venger Hunt!
:[gong strikes]
:'''Students''': [chattering]
:'''Spike''': C'mon! We can use Twilight's observatory to watch the teams!

:'''Students''': [chatter continues]
:'''Smolder''': I hope you know where you're going.
:'''Ocellus''': To the Helm of Yksler!
:'''Smolder''': Eh, works for me.
:'''Ocellus''': In our book, it says Yksler was an honorable yak warrior. Any enemies that saw him put down their weapons in peace. I think his artifact must be in one of these suits of armor.
:'''Smolder''': I'm guessing that one.
:[shields flash]
:'''Ocellus''': Yes! One down, five to go!
:[slaps]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Awww, Ocellus and Smolder found their first artifact! Wait. What's that?

:'''Ocellus''': Uh, I don't think that's part of the Spell-venger Hunt!
:'''Ocellus''' and '''Smolder''': [scream]
:'''Ocellus''': The school is haunted!
:'''Smolder''': And not cool!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Spike''': [gasp]

:'''Silverstream''': We're totally gonna win this Spell-venger Hunt!
:'''Gallus''': Yeah, I doubt that. But at least I know where one of the artifacts is. Saw Spike hide it yesterday.
:[thud]
:'''Gallus''': The Crown of Grover! Score!
:[shimmer!]
:'''Gallus''': They say it's magic ''and'' King Grover used it to become the first ruler of Griffonstone. I know, pretty sweet, right?
:'''Silverstream''': You paid attention in class!
:'''Gallus''': What?! I-If you ever tell an—
:[slam!]
:'''Gallus''': Whoa!
:'''Silverstream''': 3D painting!
:'''King Grover Painting''': [screeches]
:'''Gallus''' and '''Silverstream''': [scream]
:'''Changeling Painting''': [hisses]
:[students screaming]
:'''Pony Painting''': [hisses]
:[students screaming]
:'''Discord's Ghost''': [laughing]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yup, that's definitely Discord. This is not good.
:'''Spike''': I thought you banished him from the school.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Only his body. Apparently, his ghost can come and go just fine. Let's go. We have to stop this.
:[lift clanking]
:'''Spike''': How? No offense, but I don't think magic is the answer against Discord.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': This time, I'm not using magic.

:'''Yona''': Hmm... What Yona look for?
:'''Sandbar''': The Shell of Knuckerbocker. It's like a seashell, but if you blow into it, you call a dragon! There's a sweet poem in our book about it. "Climb to the heights with dragon flight." [gasps] Like flight of stairs!
:'''Yona''': Yona take pony word for it.
:[squish]
:'''Yona''': Huh?
:'''Sandbar''': [grunts] What's happening?!
:'''Yona''': Ugh! Yona not know! But Yona ''do'' know Yona not like Spell-venger Hunt!
:'''Discord's Ghost''': [laughing] Boo! Boo! Boo!
:[students screaming]
:'''Ocellus''': [yelps] Whoa!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Everycreature, stop!
:'''Silverstream''': B-B-B-But the school is haunted!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It's not haunted. It's Discord.
:[poof!]
:'''Discord's Ghost''': Headmare Starlight! Look at me! Look! I won the Spell-venger Hunt! Well done, me! Now what's my prize?
:'''Spike''': Detention.
:'''Discord's Ghost''': Well, that's disappointing.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Discord, you can't keep messing up the school.
:'''Discord's Ghost''': On the contrary. I think I rather can. And will.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Then I have just one thing to say to you.
:'''Discord's Ghost''': Oh, do go on.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm sorry.
:'''Discord's Ghost''': What?
:[zap!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I had to stop thinking like a headmare and start thinking like a guidance counselor to finally understand. You felt left out.
:'''Discord''': Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Nopony ever invited you to the school. And when you offered to help, I didn't listen. I was so worried about doing things Twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a good friend. I'd like to apologize for that. And offer you the job of vice headmare.
:'''Spike''': Huh?
:'''Silverstream''': Really?!
:'''Gallus''': What?!
:'''Ocellus''': Why?!
:'''Yona''': No!
:'''Smolder''': Him?!
:'''Sandbar''': Totally confused.
:'''Discord''': I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space...
:'''Spike''': You're new to the world of education, aren't you?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?
:'''Discord''': But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.
:'''Spike''': Hey! Watch the wings!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Now, Vice Headmare Discord, if you'll help me get this Spell-venger Hunt back in order.
:'''Discord''': [snaps fingers] Everything is re-hidden.
:[rattling]
:'''Silverstream''': [screams]
:'''Discord''': [chuckles] Well, with a few surprises.
:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''Discord!'' I can't believe you tricked us into going on a friendship quest that wasn't real!
:'''Discord''': Oh, back so soon?
:'''Rarity''': A glamour spell on our cutie marks?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': A fake summons from the map?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey, at least we got to go spelunking in that really creepy cave with all those eyeless worm creatures chasing us.
:'''Yona''': Oh, Yona so glad ponies back!
:'''Applejack''': Uh, y'all get the feelin' we missed somethin'?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks for taking care of the school, Starlight.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It was a challenge. Heh. But I think things turned out just the way you'd have handled them.
:'''Spike''': [to Discord] Guess this means you're not vice headmare anymore.
:'''Discord''': Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards!

:'''[Sandbar]'''
::Ponies' voices fill the night
::Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
:Come on, everycreature! Sing!
:[chatter stops]
:[chatter continues]
:'''[Sandbar]'''
::La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
::La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
:'''[Ocellus]'''
::[hesitantly] La-la-la-la... la...
:'''Yona''': Not everycreature celebrate same way, you know.
:'''Smolder''': Yeah. Dragons don't do pony holidays.
:'''Spike''': Sure we do! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! It's all about friends and presents and family and... presents!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's also about putting aside differences to come together, like the Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns did on the first holiday.
:'''Ocellus''': Oh! Is that why you put their Fire of Friendship on top of the tree? To help us remember their unity?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''And'' 'cause it looks cool.
:'''Silverstream''': This is my favorite day of the year! [giggles] Not that I don't like the other ones. Tuesdays are great!
:'''Yona''': Yona like any day that is start of winter break.
:'''Gallus''': Two whole weeks without classes. How will Ocellus survive?
:'''Ocellus''': [laughs nervously]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think you'll all enjoy the time off to be home with your families. To celebrate your own traditions. Attention, everycreature! School is officially out! Happy holidays, and we'll see you after the break!
:[excited chatter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And for those of you traveling outside Equestria...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, shouldn't you guys be getting ready to go? If you miss that train, it's a really long walk.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Go pack up, and we'll take you to the station.
:'''Young Six''': [chatting excitedly]
:[rattling]
:'''Spike''': It's that new bowtie I wanted, isn't it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You'll have to wait and see.
:'''Spike''': I'm waiting! But in the meantime, I'm shaking!
:[sprinkling]
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''', '''Rainbow Dash''', and '''Spike''': [gasp]
:[bubbling]
:'''Spike''': [gasps]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Spike''': [gasps]
:[splash!]
:'''Spike''': [grunting]
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunting]
:[snap!]
:'''Spike''': Wha... What happened?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Everything's ruined – that's what's happened!
:[whoosh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And I don't think it was an accident. Somepony was up here!
:'''Spike''': Over there!
:[window creaks]
:[wind whistling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Outside!
:[wind whistling]
:[door slams]
:'''Spike''': That's the students' quarters!
:[door slams]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Might as well give up, whoever you are! We got ya cornered!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hello? Is anypony there?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'll check the back door!
:[door opens]
:'''Silverstream''': What's happening? [gasps] Another decorating party?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Has anycreature come in here?
:'''Smolder''': Well, yeah. All of us did. To pack? Like you told us to?
:'''Spike''': ''After'' that. Did you hear anything?
:'''Silverstream''' and '''Smolder''': Uh-uh.
:[door opens]
:'''Gallus''': What's up?
:[door opens]
:'''Yona''': Yona done packing!
:[door opens]
:'''Ocellus''': Is something wrong?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunts] The back door's locked! No way out!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But whoever did it had to have come in here! We saw them!
:'''Ocellus''': Whoever did what?

:'''Sandbar''': Whoa... That is so not cool.
:'''Spike''': ''And'' whoever did it ran into ''your'' rooms. No one came out, and all of ''you'' are still here.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': One of you must have done this! But... why would any of you want to sabotage Hearth's Warming Eve?
:'''Young Six''': [muttering nervously]
:'''Yona''': Ugh! Yak not do this! Yona offended by accusation!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We don't know what happened. Maybe this wasn't even on purpose. But I want to give whoever caused this mess a chance to tell the truth and explain themselves. I'll make it easy for you. Close your eyes. Now, if you did this, raise your hoof. Or claw. Or whatever.
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Come on, Spike. Looks like we have to— Spike, you can open your eyes.
:'''Spike''': What? Oh!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, what about me?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You ''all'' can.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But since nocreature took responsibility for this mess, you're ''all'' gonna have to help clean it up before you can go home.
:'''Young Six''': [protesting]
:'''Smolder''': Why do I have to stay?!
:'''Sandbar''': Aw, but the holidays!
:[magic sounds]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': While you're cleaning, we'll bring you into my office one at a time. Since honesty is one of the Elements of Harmony, we want to give you each a chance to tell us the truth.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And once we find out who did it, just you wait! We're gonna...! We'll...! What are we gonna do exactly?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] The guilty party won't be going home over Hearth's Warming break. She or he will stay here for some one-on-one friendship lessons.
:'''Silverstream''': But what if none of us confesses?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then... [sighs] I guess there's no holidays for anycreature. You'll ''all'' stay over the break.
:'''Young Six''': [gasp]

:[water splashing]
:[splat]
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All right, let's get to the bottom of this. Who wants to be interviewed first?
:'''Gallus''': Eh. I'll go. Beats mop duty.
:'''Silverstream''': Hey, I know! We can make a game out of this! See who finishes cleaning up first!
:'''Yona''': Woo-hoo! Yak win! Yak best at cleaning! [grunting]
:'''Smolder''': Let's save time and cut to the chase. Which one of you did it?
:'''Ocellus''': I would never do something this horrible! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! And I do ''not'' want to miss going home for it.
:'''Sandbar''': Huh. I didn't even know changelings celebrated Hearth's Warming.
:'''Ocellus''': Oh, yes! It's our favorite holiday! Well, since Headmare Twilight shared it with us last year. She gave our hive very clear instructions.

:'''Ocellus''': [clears throat, reading] "Welcome to the traditions and fun of Hearth's Warming! Here's a guide to help you enjoy this celebration of pony history. Families start the holidays by putting the tree up!"

:[creaking]

:'''Ocellus''': [reading] "Thirsty? Dive into some holiday punch!"

:[splash!]
:'''Changelings''': [laughing]

:'''Ocellus''': [reading] "Just before bed, everypony exchanges gifts."

:'''Ocellus''': It doesn't say how long we keep doing this.

:'''Ocellus''': [reading] "And to finish celebrating, you can build a fire, light it up, and sing carols."

:'''[Changelings]''':
::Carols, carols, carols, carols, caroooools
:[laughing]

:'''Sandbar''': You might have misunderstood things just a little.
:'''Ocellus''': Eh. We may not have done everything exactly the way you do. But we made our own traditions! And I can't wait to do it all again this year!
:'''Smolder''': If we ever get out of here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Ocellus? Your turn.
:[foreboding music]
:[doors close]
:'''Silverstream''': What happened?
:'''Gallus''': What do you think happened? I told her I didn't do it.
:'''Yona''': Ugh! Yona tired of waiting! Yaks ''always'' home for holidays!
:'''Sandbar''': How do you celebrate Hearth's Warming in Yakyakistan, Yona?
:'''Yona''': Yaks do not. Our holiday much better. Is called Snilldar Fest. Night before, yaks gather things to smash and put them in big pile. Then in morning, we smash them! In afternoon, we smash them again! In evening—
:'''Gallus''': So it's just about smashing stuff, like all your other holidays.
:'''Yona''': No! How griffon get that idea? This holiday about so much more. Last year, for example. Most perfect Snilldar ever.

:'''Yona''': [voiceover] Whole family – grandpa, grandma yak, Yona's brother, sister, mother, father yak – all go to woods singing yak song.
:'''[Yona and family]'''
::Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!
::Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!
::Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!
:'''Yona''': [voiceover] Calves in family pick out perfect smashing log. Then yaks smash it!
:[yaks yelling and grunting]
:'''Yona''': [voiceover] Then yak family build perfect snow fort... and smash it!
:[crash!]
:'''Yona''': [voiceover] Then we hang perfect things on perfect moss pile and—

:'''All but Yona''': You smash it.
:'''Yona''': What you think yaks are, barbarians? Moss pile is for special family rituals. Last year, ritual for Yona.

:'''Yona''': [voiceover] All yak family gather around Yona and braid Yona hair for first time.

:'''Gallus''': So, to recap... Your holiday is about smashing things and family.
:'''Yona''': Two most perfect things ever put together. Happy Snilldar Fest! [yelling and grunting]
:'''Silverstream''': Happy Snilldar to you too, Yona! It's so cool to learn new traditions from new friends!
:[clatter]
:'''Smolder''': Yeah, well, one of these new friends has gotten us all in trouble. And they'd better confess soon.
:'''Ocellus''': Sandbar? Sorry, but they said they want you to go in next.
:[mop clatters]
:'''Silverstream''': Why the rush to get home, Smolder? Like you said, dragons don't really have holidays, do they?
:'''Smolder''': Meh.
:'''Ocellus''': [gasps] That's so sad! You must do ''something'' in the winter for fun.
:'''Smolder''': Well, we do have the Feast of Fire. Everydragon gets together and tells stories. The best one wins a pile of gemstones.
:'''Yona''': Ooh, what story won last year?
:'''Smolder''': It was called "A Dream Come True".
:'''Silverstream''': Come on, now you've gotta tell it!
:'''Smolder''': Ugh, fine. Once upon a time, there was this sad little dragon.

:[thunderclap]
:'''Smolder''': [narrating] Her name was Scales. She lived alone in the wilderness with nothing to eat.
:[stomach growls]
:'''Smolder''': [narrating] But one night, as she sat alone in a storm, she heard something. It was the Dragon Lord! Scales was scared, but the Dragon Lord told her not to be afraid, that he was taking her to the Dragon Lands for a great feast.
:[dragons munching]
:'''Smolder''': [narrating] Scales sat with the Dragon Lord's family and friends and had the biggest, best dinner of gemstones she'd ever eaten! Then, while the dragons were telling stories, Scales thought it would be so easy to seize power from this feeble and sensitive Dragon Lord. She saw her chance... and took it!
:[flames bursting]
:'''Smolder''': [narrating] She claimed the Bloodstone Scepter and took over the Dragon Lands! [as Scales, evil laughter] And forced the Dragon Lord to live out in the cold, just as she used to!

:'''Ocellus''': That's a horrible story!
:'''Smolder''': Maybe to you. But dragons like hearing about weak, kind creatures getting defeated.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Silverstream! You're up! Let's go!
:[door closes]
:'''Smolder''': So, did you tell them you did it?
:'''Sandbar''': What?! No way! Why would I say that?
:'''Smolder''': You already live in Ponyville. Staying here over break is no big deal.
:'''Yona''': School of Friendship good place for pony to have pony holiday.
:'''Sandbar''': I'd still rather spend it with my family at home. Oh! That reminds me! I have the best holiday story ever! It's called...

:'''Sandbar''': [voiceover] "The Day My Hearth's Warming Doll Almost Fell into the Fire!"
:'''All but Sandbar''': [sounds of awe]
:'''Sandbar''': [voiceover] Just before we went to bed, my mom, my dad, and my sister all put our Hearth's Warming Dolls up on the mantel, just like we do every year. But ''this'' year, I put my doll too close to the edge, and it fell!
:'''Sandbar''': [in slow motion] ''Nooooooo!''

:'''Ocellus''': [gasps] And?!
:'''Sandbar''': My doll hit the floor. ''But'' it could have gone in the fire!
:'''Smolder''': [sarcastic] That's a great story. And you told it really well.
:'''Sandbar''': Yeah. It was a Hearth's Warming miracle.
:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Next! Smolder, come with me. Yona, Twilight's waiting for you.
:[door closes]
:'''Ocellus''': The last two. So if neither one of them confesses, that means...
:'''Silverstream''': We're never going home!

:'''Ocellus''': We'll be here forever!
:'''Sandbar''': Beyond forever.
:'''Silverstream''': But I can't miss the Three Days of Freedom Celebration!
:'''Gallus''': [sarcastic] How long does that last?
:'''Silverstream''': It used to be only one day, but now to commemorate our escape from the Storm King, we're adding two more days of awesome! See?
:'''Gallus''': There's a book?
:'''Silverstream''': Mm-hmm! Queen Novo had these made for the Mount Aris board of tourism to explain it all to guests!

:'''Silverstream''': [voiceover] We'll spend the first night in Seaquestria, thanking the ocean for protecting us from the Storm King. Sea-dancing, whale-singing, shell-stringing... Lots of "ing"'s.
:[splash]
:'''Silverstream''': [voiceover] The second day will be on Mount Aris, with sky-dancing and a wind song in the Harmonizing Heights to celebrate the Storm King's defeat. Then the third day, everycreature will party together, on land ''and'' sea! Grandparents and parents and sisters, uncles, brothers, acquaintances, neighbors, and cousins. And at the end of the night, Queen Novo is gonna give out presents!

:'''Gallus''': Wait. Hold on. "Cousins"? What are those?
:'''Ocellus''': Your aunts and uncles' children. You know, part of your family. Heh. Oh. You're teasing us again, right?
:[door opens]
:'''Sandbar''': I'm guessing neither one of you confessed.
:'''Yona''': [sighs] Headmare Twilight say wait here.
:'''Silverstream''': Maybe they're changing their minds about sending us home.
:'''Smolder''': Why would they? Face it. We're stuck here.
:'''Ocellus''': [sniffles] But-but-but I ''have'' to go home!
:'''Silverstream''': My mom makes the best kelp fritters.
:'''Sandbar''': How can you be so cool about this?
:'''Smolder''': We're mad. We just show it differently.
:'''Sandbar''': More like you don't show it at all.
:'''Yona''': What pony getting at?
:'''Silverstream''': Maybe it wasn't just one prankster. Maybe there were three of you. And you're trying to hide your guilt by not being upset!
:'''Ocellus''': It does make sense.
:'''Gallus''': Guys, stop it.
:'''Smolder''': ''Or'' maybe whoever did it is only pretending to be upset to throw us off.
:'''Ocellus''': Me?! But I didn't!
:'''Gallus''': Come on, let it go.
:'''All but Gallus''': [arguing]
:'''Sandbar''': Come on! Ocellus, you know you did it! Just fess up!
:'''All but Gallus''': [shouting]
:'''Gallus''': I said, ''stop fighting!'' That's not what the holidays are about! No matter what you call them or how you celebrate! D-Do you know how lucky you all are? With your stories about sharing and-and kindness and getting together with everycreature that you care about?
:'''Ocellus''': But griffons do that too, don't they?
:'''Smolder''': Some holiday about a moon?
:'''Gallus''': [sighs] Blue Moon Festival. The ''one'' time of year when griffons are nice to each other. Well, as nice as we can be.

:'''Gallus''': [voiceover] Families get together to eat and then complain about the food and give each other presents they don't like and mostly just try not to yell at each other.

:'''Silverstream''': Well, at least you get to be with your family.
:'''Gallus''': No... because I don't ''have'' a family.

:'''Sandbar''': [voiceover] What about Grampa Gruff?
:'''Gallus''': [voiceover] That's just his name. He's not anygriff's actual grandpa. I felt like I never had a place in Griffonstone.

:'''Gallus''': Then I came here and, well, met all of you. So I don't want to go home for the break. And that's why... I did it!
:'''Yona''': [gasps] Griffon mess up decorations?!
:'''Gallus''': Yeah. It was me. I put goo powder in the Fire of Friendship.
:'''All but Gallus''': [gasps]
:'''Sandbar''': So it wasn't Ocellus?
:'''Ocellus''': Why would you ruin things for us?
:'''Gallus''': I didn't plan to! I just figured if I made a mess, our teachers would make us stay to clean up. We'd be together a little longer.
:'''Smolder''': Well, it worked, didn't it?
:'''Gallus''': Better than I thought. And when Headmare Twilight threatened to cancel winter break, that meant I would get to be with all of you through the entire holiday. That's why I didn't confess.
:'''Sandbar''': So, why are you admitting this now?
:'''Gallus''': I hated seeing all you fighting and-and blaming each other. That's the opposite of what all your holidays mean. Except maybe yours, Smolder. I can't keep all of you from the happiness of your homes and families just because I feel bad. I'm sorry. Don't worry. You won't have to tell our teachers. I will.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You don't have to. We already know.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We kinda guessed it was you. But we wanted to give you the chance to tell the truth.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm proud that you did, and I'm glad to see you've been paying attention in Professor Applejack's honesty classes. But you're still going to have to make amends and stay over break for extra friendship lessons by yourself.
:'''Silverstream''': I'll stay with him.
:'''Ocellus''': Me, too!
:'''Yona''': Yona stay also!
:'''Sandbar''': I'm staying!
:[beat]
:'''Smolder''': What? All right. I guess pony holidays can't be that bad.
:'''Sandbar''': Now you can finally know what it's like to spend Hearth's Warming with friends who care about you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Looks like they don't really need any extra lessons.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Since you obviously know that Hearth's Warming is about coming together, I'd be honored if all of you would join my friends as guests at our holiday table.
:'''Young Six''': [cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''After'' we finish cleaning up.
:'''Young Six''': [cheering]

:'''Sandbar''': Hey, this reminds me of another story! "The Time I Almost Spilled Grape Juice on the White Couch"!
:'''Smolder''': Does it have a depressing ending?
:'''Ocellus''': I'm not sure pony stories work that way.
:'''Yona''': Gallus want Yona braid feathers?
:'''Gallus''': Uhhh... pass.
:'''[Silverstream]'''
::Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!

{{Infobox Transcript}}
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': [voiceover] Dear Twilight, it is difficult to express how grateful I am to you for teaching me the power of friendship.
:'''Rare Find''': [grunts]
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': [voiceover] You would think after more than a thousand years, there would be nothing left to learn.
:[wind whistling]
:[clang!]
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': [voiceover] And yet, even a pony as old as I can continue to be surprised by how much there is to know.
:[teleportation zap]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "I hope you find these postcards enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing you again, though I can't say when my journey will be complete. Your friend, Star Swirl."
:'''Rarity''': It must be gratifying to have your idol writing to ''you'' about the friendship lessons ''he's'' learning.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm not sure I'll ever get used to it. Of course, if he ''really'' wants to learn about friendship, he could just come to our school.
:[door opens]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Professor Sparkle? The mailpony just came with, uh, a few things.
:[door squeaks]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! The sewing machines I ordered for my class!
:'''Cozy Glow''': These came, too. I wasn't sure what to make of them.
:'''Rarity''': These machines were costly, but I am quite certain the friendship lessons I can teach my students with them will be invaluable.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Rarity''': Oh, don't worry, darling. I'll think of something. And I didn't use the school funds to buy these. I made the purchase entirely with my own bits.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's not that. It's this!
:'''Rarity''': [reading] "Why waste your time at a friendship school that's just a school? Learn everything they teach and more at Friendship University"?!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Who would open another friendship school?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, pfft! I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. You're the Princess of Friendship. What could this other school possibly offer?
:'''Smolder''': It isn't just another friendship school. It's a university!
:'''Ocellus''': It says they teach the same lessons of competing schools in half the time. That's twice the learning!
:'''Gallus''': And it's in Las Pegasus? If Professor Rarity lets us skip her sewing class – road trip!
:'''Young Six''': [excited chatter]
:'''Rarity''': I think we need to look into this school.

:'''Rarity''': I don't like to judge solely on appearances. But... what kind of friendship school is this?
:'''"Polo Play"''': Only the best friendship school in the west... and maybe all of Equestria!
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': There's more ponies in here than at our whole school. Who is running this place?
:[clank]
:'''Flim''': [echoing] Welcome, friends! You are about to embark on a journey of amazing magnitude! One that will change your lives forever!
:'''Flam''': [echoing] Prepare yourselves to embrace a new path and become students of...
:'''Flim''' and '''Flam''': Friendship U!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Flim and Flam. Of course.
{{#lst:Friendship U|song}}
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Accredited?
:'''Flam''': It means officially recognized or authorized.
:'''Rarity''': We know what it means. But who would accredit this place?
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Why, the EEA, of course.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Chancellor Neighsay?!
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': The Equestria Educational Association has taken an interest in institutions that teach friendship in a pony-first environment. Surely you didn't think your school has a monopoly on the concept?
:'''Rarity''': Well, she did write the book on it.
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Ah, yes. How to teach friendship to ''creatures'' who will one day use it as a weapon against us.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': How could they use friendship as a weapon?!
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': You tell me. It's ''your'' book. Meantime, this university appears to be a promising option for ''ponies'' who'd prefer to stick to the EEA book on the subject.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can't be serious. They're obviously up to something. It's Flim and Flam!
:'''Flim''': [gasps] Well, that certainly wasn't friendly.
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': One would think the headmare of a school of friendship – albeit an unaccredited one – would behave differently. Unless she was trying to undermine the competition? Hmm?
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I— No! What?! I-I am not!
:'''Audience Pony''': I did think the Princess of Friendship would be friendlier.
:'''Flam''': Now, now, fillies and gentlecolts. Let's show the princess just how friendly we are by signing up for some classes!
:[ponies cheering]
:'''Flim''': Why don't I show you around?

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sorry, but approval from the EEA won't convince me that this school is what you promise.
:'''Flim''': And what ''would'' it take to convince you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, somepony whose opinion I respect, for one.
:'''Flim''': Really? Somepony like... this?
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Rarity''': [gasp]
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': Twilight?
:'''Rarity''': Uh-oh.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Star Swirl? What are you doing here?
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': Why, studying friendship at Flim and Flam's wonderful school!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, please. I think I know a disguise when I see one. Take off that ridiculous beard... ''Flam!''
:[stretching sound]
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': [screams]
:'''Flam''': How's it going in here?
:[snap!]
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': [groans] It-It's really me.
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': I'd heard rumors you've returned, but I didn't believe it until now. And if a pony of your stature is studying here, there really isn't anything else I need to see. I, Chancellor Neighsay, hereby confer upon Friendship University complete and unreserved EEA accreditation!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I... I don't understand. Why would you come here and not ''my'' school?
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': My travels brought me to Las Pegasus. I didn't come for the school, but Flim and Flam convinced me to try it out.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can't trust Flim and Flam! They tried to con the Apples out of their farm! They sold fake health tonic! They run a resort in Las Pegasus!
:'''Flam''': Technically, our resort is a legitimate business.
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': I spent a thousand years thinking the worst of a "bad" pony. You taught me to look for the best in him. Whatever Flim and Flam's past may be, starting this school shows they want to change for the better.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I wish I could believe that.
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': Besides, what's untrustworthy about opening a school of friendship? They don't even charge for classes.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know. But I know they're up to something. And until I find out, I'm begging you, come to my school instead.
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': I understand feeling threatened by competition, but my word, Princess. I wonder if the ill manners of the ''creatures'' at your school aren't contagious. I think I will take my leave before I become infected.
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': Twilight, I promise I'll visit your school soon. But for now, perhaps it's best if you return there.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You don't think they're running an actual friendship school, do you?
:'''Rarity''': Darling, of course not. Which is why we have to investigate!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But we can't go poking around the school. Everypony'll think I'm still just "threatened by the competition".
:'''Rarity''': Only if we do it as ourselves.
:[door opens]
:[door closes]

:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:'''Rarity''': In these disguises, we could pass as students at out own school.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [muffled] I don't know, Rarity.
:'''Rarity''': Ah-ah. What did I say about using our real names?
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, "Plainity". But I'm pretty sure ''this'' isn't enough of a disguise.
:[door closes]
:'''"Polo Play"''': Hey, strangers! Are you two new here?
:'''{{H:title|as "Plainity"|Rarity}}''': [blows bubblegum] We sure are. Completely new.
:'''"Polo Play"''': Great! See ya in class!
:'''Rarity''': [squeals] Now, I've read enough ''Shadow Spade'' to know the key to going undercover is rehearsing your backstory. [clears throat] [in affected voice] I'm "Plainity", and I love bland old normal stuff. No frills for me. [normal voice] Okay! Your turn.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] My name's Eyepatch. I have an eye patch.
:'''Rarity''': Perfect! Now, how do we start our investigation?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think we should split up. You enroll in some classes and find out what they're actually teaching. I'll look around and see what I can find, assuming I'm not recognized.

:'''Flam''': Welcome, newest students! Let's dive right in, shall we? One of the most important elements of friendship is being thoughtful. True or false?
:[students chattering eagerly]
:'''{{H:title|as "Plainity"|Rarity}}''': If by "thoughtful" you mean "generous", I'd say true.
:'''Flam''': Correct! [laughs] It was a trick question. Very impressive, Miss...?
:'''{{H:title|as "Plainity"|Rarity}}''': Plainity.
:'''Flam''': Well, well, well, Miss Plainity, keep it up and you'll be ready for our next level in no time!
:[students' sounds of awe]
:'''Flam''': Now, let's see if you can demonstrate for the class. What's something generous you could do for... me right now?
:[zip!]
:'''Flam''': Class, Plainity here is now my star pupil. If any of you want a chance at studying with Star Swirl, I'd take notes on her every action.
:[writing sounds]

:[door creaks]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hello? The door is open, so I'll just assume it's okay to come in and look around. Unless somepony says it's not. All right, then.
:[door closes]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "The Element of Laughter and its applications." Okay, that seems pretty genuine. "When to support your friends' decisions and when to talk sense." Huh. That's actually kind of interesting. Aha! "Friendship University's true goal... is to help friends become better friends"? [groans] Where is the proof that it's all a scam?
:'''Flam''': There isn't any!
:[click]
:[camera flashes]
:'''Flim''': Twilight Sparkle! Did you really think an eye patch was enough of a disguise?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No, I didn't!
:'''Flam''': Well, then we agree that everypony will recognize the Princess of Friendship in this photo of you sneaking into our office.
:'''Flim''': I can see the headline now! "Princess of Jealousy! Twilight Sparkle Bent on Ruining Her Competition!"
:'''Flam''': So sad. A news story like that would destroy your reputation. Nopony will want to go to your school after that.

:'''Flam''': Just wait until the papers get a hold of this!
:'''Flim''': "Princess Unhinged!" It'll be the talk of Equestria!
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': Well, gentleponies, I've finished another stack. The lessons in these worksheets are quite fascinating. Twilight? What's going on here?
:'''Flim''': Oh, just your protégé getting caught snooping in our office in disguise! Well, sort of.
:'''Flam''': Oh, honestly, Princess Twilight, envy does not look good on you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm not envious! I know these two are up to something. I'm just trying to find out what.
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': The only pony I see who is up to something is the pony in this picture, and it is not the princess I know.
:'''Flim''': Well, it's about to be the princess all of Equestria knows.
:'''Flam''': Unless... you decided to drop the whole "uncover the scam" thing.
:'''Flim''': Then we'll rip this silly picture up and ''not'' let it completely and utterly ruin you and your school.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpers]

:'''{{H:title|as "Plainity"|Rarity}}''': You can be generous with all sorts of things. Gifts, compliments, your time.
:[ponies chattering excitedly]
:'''Rarity''': Hey, Eyepatch! Where's your eye patch? [gasps] Was your cover blown?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You could say that. Flim and Flam took a picture of me sneaking into their office.
:'''Rarity''': Were we wearing our eye patch?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If I don't stop investigating, they're going to tell everypony that I'm trying to sabotage their school because I'm jealous.
:'''Rarity''': But-But-But that's ridiculous!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't know. Maybe I ''am'' just upset that Star Swirl came here instead of my school. Flim and Flam may have turned over a new leaf. We should probably just go home.
:'''Rarity''': Twilight, you are not the kind of pony to let your emotions cloud your judgment. If you think Flim and Flam are up to no good, you can't give up, even if their lessons really are impressive.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait, what?!
:'''Rarity''': Which reminds me. Can you get a message to Spike? I want to return those sewing machines. I need the bits if I'm going to keep advancing here. Tuition's free, but the worksheets sure aren't. [laughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Flim and Flam are charging for these?
:'''Rarity''': Well, they have to cover expenses, and Flam insists that everything extra goes to improving the school and—
:[beat]
:'''Rarity''': This is the scam, isn't it?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Let's find out.

:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': These lessons are so valuable. Are you sure I can't give you more?
:'''Flam''': Ah-ah-ah! Unnecessary! Being able to share them with a pony like you is our real reward. [to Destitute Pony] Oh, my. And you want to study alongside Star Swirl, hmm?
:'''Destitute Pony''': It's all I have.
:[paper rips]
:'''Flim''': Come back for the rest when you can afford it.
:'''Destitute Pony''': W-Wait! I'll sell the shirt off my back!
:'''Flam''': And that's the kind of determination that'll get you to the next level, student whose... name I know!
:'''Rarity''': [whispering] Twilight, maybe I should take over the investigation. Think of your reputation!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': My reputation isn't worth much if I won't risk it for what I think is right. Besides, I have a plan.

:[door opens]
:[door closes]
:[door opens]
:[cranking sounds]
:[door slams]

:[door opens]
:[bits jingling]
:'''Flim''': Well, brother of mine, we've got almost all the bits we need to expand our resort. If we add another level of classes and worksheets, we'll be there.
:'''Flam''': Maybe we should add two levels, just to be safe.
:[beep!]
:[powering-up sounds]
:[water running]
:'''Flim''': [sighs] It's a thing of beauty. But I was thinking. What if we added another extreme pool slide here?
:'''Flam''': Mmmm... Sure, as long as the pipes for the musical chocolate fountain go through... here.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But shouldn't it go closer to the pudding hot tub here?
:'''Flim''': Fair point, but— ''What?!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I knew your school was a scam!
:'''Flim''': Well, well, well, if it isn't the Princess of Jealousy. I guess we'll be going to the papers after all.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And I suppose I'll just lead your students into this secret room of bits and resort expansion plans!
:'''Flam''': Uhhhh... l-let's not get hasty. You have something on us. We have something on you. Let's just call it even.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think so. You can destroy my reputation if you want, but using your students' bits to expand your resort is wrong, even if the lessons you teach are good ones.
:'''Flam''': Of course they're good. We copied them from ''your'' book.
:'''Flim''': We just skipped every other page. All the lessons, half the time!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] Fine. If you really want to call it even, give back the bits and stop charging for my lessons. Then you can teach them as much as you like.
:'''Flim''' and '''Flam''': Nah!
:'''Flim''': Running a school is more work than we thought. Besides, we almost have everything we need.
:[zip!]
:'''{{H:title|as "Plainity"|Rarity}}''': I think not!
:'''Flam''': Plainity? My star pupil?
:'''Rarity''': [affected voice] Not Plainity, but... [normal voice] Rarity!
:[beat]
:'''Flim''': Who?
:'''Rarity''': We decided to bring somepony else here to listen to everything you just said!
:'''Flim''': [stutters] Hey, Star Swirl. We were just about to—
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': Return the bits you've collected from your students and close your school?
:'''Flam''': [gulps] Yeah. That.

:[bits jingling]
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': [sighs] It seems I'll never stop learning from your example, Twilight. It is a valuable lesson to stand up for what you know is true. I wish I had known it, too.
:'''Student 4''': Thanks for returning our bits. But how are we going to learn about friendship now?
:[disappointed murmuring]
:'''Star Swirl the Bearded''': Well, I can refer you to a fairly reputable establishment just outside of Ponyville. I'm quite certain the headmare would consider letting you in.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [giggles]
:[students cheering]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [reading] "Of course, if I ever go to a school again, I'll make sure it's yours. In friendship, Star Swirl."
:'''Rarity''': I still don't understand how Flim and Flam could have gotten a copy of your book.
:[door opens]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Uh, I finished straightening up in the library. Professor Rarity, I just wanted to make sure you're definitely keeping these.
:'''Rarity''': But of course, darling. If there's one thing I learned at Friendship University, it is not to give up when you know what's right. And I know teaching friendship through sewing is right! I just need to figure out how.

:[school bell rings]
:[door opens]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh! Rarity! Just the pony I'm looking for! Can you come to Twilight's class with me? It won't take long.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, I'd love to help, but I have to meet Rainbow Dash for our day of fun together.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Twilight wants to use you as an example for the students.
:'''Rarity''': Ooh!

:[door opens]
:'''Rarity''': Your example is here! [laughs] Oh!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I thought ''I'' was the example.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You ''both'' are. Because together, you perfectly demonstrate my lesson on compromise in friendship. Rainbow Dash and Rarity have very different interests that keep them busy. But being friends is so important to them, they always manage to make time for each other.
:'''Rarity''': [laughs nervously] Our day of fun ''was'' hard to plan, what with Rainbow Dash's extremely time-consuming and erratically scheduled Wonderbolts practice.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And Rarity's weird fashion seasons. She's working on her winter collection, and it's not even summer yet!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But you still found time to be together, and that's what counts. See, class? These ponies are models of true friendship in action.
:[pencils scribbling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thanks for stopping by! Enjoy your day of fun!
:'''Silverstream''': Ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! What amazing stuff are you gonna do together?!
{|

:'''Rarity''':
:Shoe shopping!
:Dress shopping!
:Fabric dyeing!
|
:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:Obstacle races!
:Buckball!
:Flight goggle shopping!
|}
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Aw, come on! I even said "shopping" that time!
:'''Rarity''': Perfect! We'll go shopping first.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But I brought stuff for buckball to—
:'''Smolder''': Are we supposed to be learning something here? 'Cause this doesn't sound like compromising at all.
:'''Gallus''': Yeah, you guys have ''nothing'' in common. How can you be friends?
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': [laughing nervously]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Even though Rainbow Dash and Rarity enjoy doing different things, there are plenty of reasons why they're friends.
:'''Yona''': Uh, like what?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] We've ''always'' been friends.
:'''Ocellus''': Always?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, no. Not always. But for like a super long time.
:'''Rarity''': And we know all the same ponies.
:'''Smolder''': Um, is that it?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, there was that time during the Cloudsdale Best Young Flyer Competition that I totally saved Rarity's life.
:'''Rarity''': Yes! And ''I'' once proved Rainbow Dash's innocence to her beloved Wonderbolts when she was being framed for a mysterious incident.
:'''Sandbar''': Cool! What else?
:'''Rainbow Dash''', '''Rarity''', and '''Twilight Sparkle''': [laugh nervously]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, look. It may seem like Rarity and Rainbow Dash don't have that much in common when you try to put it into words, but sometimes friendships can't ''be'' explained. You just have to see them in action to understand.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually, that's a ''great'' idea!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Just go about your day of fun as you normally would. You won't even know we're here!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [singsongy] Game on!
:[sports theme]
:[thwacking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rarity! You were supposed to be holding your bucket!
:'''Rarity''': Hmm? Oh! Sorry, darling. Wearing this drab jersey gave me an idea for a buckball-inspired line of "athleisure" wear that would allow for maximum flexibility ''and'' style! Uh, but I'm ready now! [blink, blink]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Good! 'Cause this time, I'm gonna try something new and super-intense!
:[sports theme continues]
:[thwacking]
:[whirr!]
:[zoom!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rarity! Are you even paying attention?!
:'''Rarity''': What? Oh! I mean, of course! Uh, I held my bucket and everything!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But you have to ''catch'' the ball!
:'''Rarity''': Really? Well, that sounds dangerous.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [quietly, to herself] Oh, forget it. She's never gonna understand the point of this game. [out loud] Buckball time is over!
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Finally!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uhhh, see? They did something Rainbow Dash likes, so now it's time for something Rarity likes. Compromise!

:'''Rarity''': Hmmm... I'm genuinely not sure. Are they too in style?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, isn't that what you want them to be?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, yes, yes. But they should be ahead of the curve. If they're in fashion right now, then they're practically already out.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That doesn't make any sense.
:'''Rarity''': Hmmm... Perhaps I should get the stilettos instead. What do you think?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Unless you like tripping with every step, heels on a horse are pretty useless.
:'''Rarity''': [nickers] ''Au contraire''. They're perfect in a multitude of situations. Formal functions, afternoon teas, evening teas, high tea, tea by the sea, royal tea—
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Can they clean up glitter? Ew! It's on my hooves! Are we done yet?! [groans] This is sooooo boring!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rainbow Dash and Rarity are just, uh, showcasing an aspect of friendship called "banter", the playful and friendly exchange of remarks. [laughs nervously] It's all in good fun.
:[pencils scribbling]

:'''Rarity''': Ooh, I cannot wait! Collecting gemstones is my favorite!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Finally, something we can agree on! Treasure hunting!
:'''Rarity''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': [laugh, hoof-bump]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': See, everycreature? That didn't take long. Now they're having a great time together.
:[pencils scribbling]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! ''Magnifique''! This will be perfect for the emerald-encrusted romper I've been working on!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cool! Now, what would be even cooler is if we could find a treasure chamber or something! Now, if I were a secret door, where would I be?
:[knocking]
:[crack]
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Ugh, Rainbow Dash! Could you please refrain from all of that racket? It's muddying my concentration.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] Look! A lever! [grunts] It's stuck! Come help me, Rarity!
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] Just a moment.
:[thumping]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [grunting]
:[crash!]
:[shatters]
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] You ruined my gems!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, well, ''you'' ruined my treasure hunt!
:'''Rarity''': Ugh! This wasn't about treasure! It was about finding gemstones for my winter collection!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who cares about clothes?! We're supposed to be on an adventure together!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh-oh.
:'''Rarity''': That... is... it! This "day of fun" is officially over!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Fine by me! Maybe I can spend some time doing something I actually ''like'' now!
:'''Young Six''': [gasp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [laughs nervously] Surely, you don't mean that. You're just having a little disagreement. [to students] Sometimes that happens between pals. But no matter what, they can always get past the problem and stay good friends.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I don't think we can. [to Rarity] You don't care about any of the things I like! It's always about you and your boring fashions!
:'''Rarity''': Oh, puh-lease! ''You'' don't even give my interests a chance! You have absolutely no respect for the finer things! ''No respect, I tell you!''
{|
|
:'''Rarity''':
:''I suppose we're just not friends anymore!''
|
:'''Rainbow Dash''':
:''I guess we're just not friends anymore!''
|}
:'''Students''': [gasp]
:[pencils scribbling]

:'''Rarity''': ...And ''then'' there was the time Rainbow Dash called my Cloudsdale Couture Boutique idea "impractical"! Imagine that! Just because I needed Twilight to perform the butterfly wing spell on me whenever I wanted to deliver merchandise!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...And I told her a thousand times Pegasi don't even ''want'' restrictive heavy dresses! We need to be able to fly! Duh!
:'''Rarity''': Not to mention the day I was wearing a really gorgeous hat, and Rainbow Dash didn't even notice!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The Wonderbolts show was ''ruined!'' Rarity's hat was blocking everypony's view!
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': [snarl]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ''Enough!'' Guidance counseling is for talking out your problems, not telling me everything that's ever happened in the history of Equestria! [groans] But I've learned sometimes talking isn't enough. You need to put yourselves in one another's shoes.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No ''way'' am I wearing those!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [groans] What I'm ''saying'' is we need a way to help you two reconnect. Follow me!
:[doors open]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': The library? And this helps us how?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You both love books. Rainbow Dash never stops talking about ''Daring Do'' adventures, and you're a huge fan of ''Shadow Spade'' mysteries.
:'''Rarity''': Your point?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': The perfect way for you two to reconnect as friends is to read each other's favorite book. I'll read them, too. Then we'll all discuss afterward. It'll be a "Good Friends Book Club". Okay? I'll bring snacks.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh! Fine!
:'''Rarity''': If you insist.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Great! We're all here! To start, why don't you two share one thing you liked about each other's books?
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Okay. I'll go first. Uh, I really enjoy the part in ''Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams'' when Daring used a vicious cragadile as a raft, and then—
:'''Rarity''': [giggles] Please.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, what's so funny?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, sorry. It's just that I find those action sequences so ridiculously over-the-top.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But they're real! You even ''met'' Daring Do!
:'''Rarity''': Yes, but the book's descriptions just drag on, and what about those silly unpronounceable names? Doctor whozit-whatsit... [Spanish pronunciation] ''Caballeron''?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ca-ba-''ller''-on! Just like it looks! How hard is that?! [snarls]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, tea, anypony? Cucumber sandwich? [laughs nervously] Or we could go over some nice ''friendly'' talking points.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [scoffs] Seriously?! Don't even get me started on those clothing descriptions in ''Shadow Spade''! What a yawn fest!
:'''Rarity''': [stutters] But... the outfit descriptions are an integral part of the plot of ''The Colt in Crimson: A Shadow Spade Mystery''!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [insincere yawning]
:'''Rarity''': You see, if you didn't know that Sir Fluffingsworth von Radishfield wears only silk, double-breasted waistcoats, you'd never deduce that he, in fact, was the culprit!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': W-Wait. He was?
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] You didn't even read it!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [quietly, to herself] I can see I'm gonna need reinforcements.
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Not ''my'' fault it's so boring and put me to sleep!
:'''Rarity''': If ''you'' can't be bothered to read the thing I like, that just further illustrates the point that we have nothing in common anymore!
:'''Cherry Fizzy''', '''Savoir Fare''', '''Rose''', '''Lyra Heartstrings''', '''Sweetie Drops''': [collective gasp]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': At least we agree on that! From now on, I'm only hanging out with ponies who ''get'' me!
:'''Cherry Fizzy''', '''Savoir Fare''', '''Rose''', '''Lyra Heartstrings''', '''Sweetie Drops''': [deeper collective gasp]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Your drama can wait! Twilight needs help! Now!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panicking noises]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [panting] Any luck?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! It's goooone!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What's gone?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Amulet of Aurora!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] One of the magical items you've been keeping for Princess Celestia?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That amulet can reverse the tides and summon tsunamis! If it falls into the wrong hooves, Equestria will be in grave danger!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't worry, Twilight! I know tons about searching for lost treasure!
:'''Rarity''': And if I follow the culprit's clues, I'm certain I can find who took your amulet!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Thank you! I'll feel so much better knowing you two are looking for it together!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': While ''we'' work on a locator spell. It's the perfect solution!
:[closet doors open]
:'''Rarity''': There appear to be no signs of damage to the surrounding artifacts, suggesting the thief did not leave in a hurry.
:[clattering]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Rarity, your boots are leaving sparkles all over the floor!
:'''Rarity''': Pfft! Those aren't from ''my'' boots. Mine are magenta, not blue. See?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]
:'''Rarity''': I mean, really!

:[doors open]
:'''Rarity''': [panting] Turns out these boots were ''not'' "made for trotting," as advertised. Where are you going?! We promised Twilight we'd work together!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't you see? The Amulet of Aurora is made out of Azurantium!
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Azurantium? You know! The same metal that the Amulet of Atonement from ''Daring Do'' book four is made from? It always leaves sparkles wherever it goes. Just like this, remember? It's from the book you just read!
:'''Rarity''': [laughs nervously] ''That'' book! Yes! The one I-I just... just read! Ha-ha-ha!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Seriously?! After giving me all that grief, you didn't read mine either?!
:'''Rarity''': Oopsie?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] As soon as we find this amulet, we are ''done'' with each other!
:'''Rarity''': Fine by me!

:'''Rarity''': [panting] Ooh! Rainbow Dash, slow down! You're flying past important clues! Look, it's a print. But definitely not a hoof. Are those claw marks?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Who cares? I found a ''bigger'' clue!
:[geyser spewing]
:'''Rarity''': I hope you don't expect me to... [shudders] ...wade through that.
:[submerging]
:[plop]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Nah. It's too deep. We'll get stuck.
:'''Rarity''': Ooh. Clever. What ''Daring Do'' book did you get ''that'' from?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Actually, I learned it at Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp.
:'''Rarity''': [sighs] At least you can fly across.
:[geysers spewing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps, grunts] Nope. If one of those geysers burns off my wing feathers, I'll be out of the Wonderbolts for weeks. [groans] I ''could''...
:[construction sounds under]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...try and slingshot my way through. But I'd need two perfectly placed trees, some stretchy rope, and a pith helmet. [groans] Too bad we can't do what Daring Do did in book four and find a cragadile for a raft.
:'''Rarity''': Ta-daaa! The ''S.S. Cragadile'', at your service!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, that... is... ''awesome!'' Uh, I mean, it's all right, I guess.
:[dragging sounds]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How did you know how to do that?
:'''Rarity''': Mmm. We may have been friends for a super-long time, but you don't know ''every''thing about me yet.
:[splashing]
:[wings revving]
:[geysers spewing]

:'''Rarity''': [gasps] The glitter trail! It's gone!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How are we supposed to find the Amulet of Aurora now?
:[leaves rustling]
:'''Bufogren''': [croaks]
:'''Rarity''': [screams]
:'''Bufogren''': [quietly] Owww. Ears. Why hoof-hoofs yell? Too, too loud.
:'''Rarity''': [loudly] Sorry! What did you say?!
:'''Bufogren''': [quietly] Too, too loud.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I think it's a Bufogren. They have really sensitive ears. [whispering loudly] Did you happen to see anycreature with a sparkly thingy go this way?
:'''Bufogren''': Saw it.
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': [gagging]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hold that thought! [gasping]
:'''Rarity''': [coughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': His breath smells so bad, I can't think! But we can't hear him from back here. Now what?
:'''Rarity''': Hmmm... [sniffs] Aha! I think I have the perfect solution. An old unicorn beauty trick. That is, if you can somehow procure us a tiny bit of cloud?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Now ''that'' I can do!
:[geyser spewing]
:[spinning]
:'''Rarity''': Ooh! It's adorable! [nose pinched] Um, excuse me, kind sir. I have a special treat for you in exchange for your information.
:'''Bufogren''': Ooh... What's that?
:'''Rarity''': [nose pinched] It is a magical unicorn delicacy called "Effervescence". Very now. Very chic. [yells]
:'''Bufogren''': Owww!
:'''Rarity''': Sorry, sorry. Enjoy.
:'''Bufogren''': Mmmmm.... My mouth. Fresh and minty. [nomming]
:'''Rarity''': [sniffs, sighs]  Good. Uh, now, which way did the sparkly thing go?
:'''Bufogren''': Up-up. Up there.
:'''Rarity''': Thank you! [to Rainbow Dash] Well, what are you waiting for? Go on! Fly up there and get that amulet!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, we're doing this ''together'', remember?
:'''Rarity''': But how can we— [screams, panicky noises, panting]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sorry, but I wasn't leaving you behind in that swamp.
:'''Rarity''': [exhales] Thank you.
:[door jiggles]
:[knocking]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh. Maybe the key to unlocking this thing is in these inscriptions.
:'''Rarity''': ''Or'' perhaps the key is right here!
:[click]
:'''Rarity''': I couldn't decide between the boots and the stilettos, so I got both!
:[lock unlatching]
:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': High heels could do that?
:'''Rarity''': And you called them "useless".
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] I shouldn't have said that. Or made fun of the other stuff you like to do. Some of it's actually sorta neat.
:'''Rarity''': I... owe you an apology, too. Buckball may not be my thing, but it's something you enjoy. And you're very good at it. I never should've treated your interests like they were worth less than mine.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Soooo... does this mean we're still friends?
:'''Rarity''': I would very much like that. Now let's go find that amulet!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! [laughs]

:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wait! That tunnel leads to the... school? A secret passage! Awesome!
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] Spikey-wikey! ''You'' stole the Amulet of Aurora?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not exactly.
:'''Rarity''': You mean, this was a setup to make us get along?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sorry to interfere, but you both...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...reeeeeally needed it.
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': [laugh]
:'''Smolder''': So even though you don't like any of the same stuff, you two are friends again?
:'''Rarity''': Heh. Always. I think we just needed a teensy reminder.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah. We don't have to love the exact same things to have fun together. I mean, imagine if we did! How boring would ''that'' be?
:'''Rarity''': When we give each other a chance to share the different things we enjoy, it can be surprisingly wonderful! [sighs] Too bad we wasted our day of fun.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We still have a little time left. You wanna... go hit the shops? I could actually use your help picking out some new buckball gear.
:'''Rarity''': Do I?! But only if you help me choose some buckball fan attire, so I can cheer for my favorite player at the drop of a fabulous hat!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, yeah! Let's go already!
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Rarity''': [laugh, happy chatter]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [to students] See? Good friends always work through their differences.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs] Even if it takes a little help.

:'''Fluttershy''': Huh? [gasps] Some poor creature's in trouble! We have to help it! Oh, listen to that suffering! It must be in horrible agony!
:[dissonant music]
:[screech]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ooh! It sounds like a herd of injured chimerae! [pants] Or it's Cerberus with snifflitis in two of its heads and kennel cough in its third. Or maybe it's—
:[screech]
:[dissonant music continues]
:'''Fluttershy''': Pinkie Pie?
:[music stops]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Thaaaaaaaat's me! And a-one, and a-two, and a-I know what to do! [inhales deeply]
:[dissonant music resumes]
:'''Fluttershy''': Ugh. At least no animal is suffering. Right, Angel?
:[plop]
:'''Fluttershy''': [laughs nervously] Well, until now.

:[dissonant music]
:[ponies screaming]
:'''Mane Six except Pinkie Pie''': [scream, groan]
:'''Applejack''': What is that thing?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's called a yovidaphone.<!--This is the spelling in the closed captions.--> It's from Yakyakistan, where it's actually quite popular.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Is it supposed to sound like that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Not exactly. It's known to produce a fairly complicated, melodically rich, and harmonious tone.
:[bird chirping]
:[bird squawks]
:[music continues]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Are you sure we're talking about the same thing?
:[blare!]
:[music ends]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [panting] Phew! And that's with only a few days of practice! Can you believe it?!
:[honk!]
:'''Rarity''': Yes. Yes, I can.
:'''Applejack''': I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it in my life.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, if you enjoyed listening to my playing half as I enjoyed playing my playing, then I should totally play more! That way, we'll be even!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I don't think that's necessary, Pinkie.
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': [agreeing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Please. Don't.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's a chance I may have missed a note or two here or there, but I just love playing so much! [sighs] You complete me.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, I, for one, am glad you're having so much fun with your new hobby.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [not listening] Uh-huh. Sure.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And it's great that you're learning a new skill, and... and you're just waiting for me to finish talking so you can start playing again, aren't ya?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': No! But if you're done... And a-one, and a-two, and a-I know what to do! [inhales deeply]
:[dissonant music resumes]
:'''Fluttershy''': [sighs, to Angel Bunny] It's okay. She's gone.
:'''Applejack''': Anypony else think that sounded like an apple core cut up in a pulp grinder?
:'''Rarity''': Apple-solutely! Uh, absolutely.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, so maybe she isn't good yet. But she's our friend, and we should be supportive.
:'''Applejack''': She just started playin'. She's ''bound'' to get better. Right?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, we just need to be supportive of her practicing... [groans] So the getting-better part happens as fast as possible.
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': [agreeing]

:[yovidaphone plays]
:'''Rarity''': Aah! Aah! [sighs]

:[animals snoring quietly]
:[bird whistling snore]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [inhales deeply]
:[yovidaphone plays]
:[animals crying]

:[crowd cheering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [inhales deeply]
:[yovidaphone plays]

:[thud]
:[yovidaphone plays]
:[splattering]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] You're absolutely right, Spike. Sometimes it ''is'' nice to get out of the library and be in the sun.
:'''Spike''': Especially when you take the library with you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chuckles]
:[screech]
:'''Applejack''': [burbles, sighs] We need to do somethin' about Pinkie Pie's playin'!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Like, now!
:'''Fluttershy''': [snoring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Is it really that bad?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Does ''this'' answer your question?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, a trophy?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': For second place. Second! Place! All because of Pinkie's playing!
:'''Rarity''': And I wanted to turn heads with my new fall line, but not like this! [sobbing]
:'''Applejack''': And thanks to her fruit-blastin' melodies, I got an orchard full of nothin' but applesauce! And it ain't even saucin' season!
:'''Rarity''': And just look what her playing did to poor Fluttershy!
:'''Fluttershy''': [snores, gasps] Oh. So very tired. [yawning] It practically took me all night to get the nursery back to sleep. [resumes snoring]
:'''Applejack''': I mean, I know we said we should all be supportive, but Pinkie's been playin' for moons now, and she's not gettin' any better.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! If anything, she's gotten worse!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, maybe we can just pretend she's really good, and then I'll find a spell that will—
:'''Applejack''': Oh, no, no, no! We're not goin' through that again! Remember how well it worked out when you weren't honest with Celestia about her actin' ability?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] You're right. We'll just have to tell Pinkie Pie she's not very good at the yovidaphone.
:[yovidaphone plays]
:[ponies screaming]
:'''Rarity''': Well, there's no time like the present.
:[music stops]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Phew! Huh, that's weird. I coulda sworn this place was packed a second ago. Hey, guys! Can I favor you all with a tune? I take requests!
:'''Applejack''': Actually, we ''do'' have a request, and yeah, it involves your yovidaphone.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You mean the thing I love more than anything else in Equestria? My sun, my moon, my stars, my everything? Ooh! Tell me, tell me, tell me!
:'''Applejack''': All right. In all honesty... Uh, in all honesty... Rarity has somethin' to say!
:'''Rarity''': Pinkie, please listen to Rainbow Dash.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh, fine! So, Pinkie, remember when we all were shocked to discover Princess Celestia wasn't so good at acting?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yeah, she was awful! But that's kind of a random thing to bring up. I thought you wanted to talk about my yovidaphone playing.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, it's, uh... It's just... You need to know, uh... Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Pinkie, we all support you, but we're afraid you're just not good at the yovidaphone, and none of us want you to waste your time on something you can't do well.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Oh. [upbeat] Why didn't you just say so?
:[air deflating]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] We were all really nervous to tell you.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Why? It's just a silly instrument. Well, lunch break's over. Gotta get back to the bakery. Those apple turnovers aren't gonna apple themselves! [whistles gleefully] No more yovidaphone playing for me-e-e!
:[door closes]
:'''Fluttershy''': Wow. She took that so much better than I thought.

:[trash can creaking]
:[honk!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sadly] No more yovidaphone playing for me. And a-one, and a-two, and I don't know what to do. [crying]

:[indistinct conversations]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs] Another beautiful day in Ponyville.
:'''Spike''': Uh, Twilight, when was the last time you saw Pinkie Pie?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmmm, not since we told her to stop playing the yovidaphone. I'm still surprised with how well she took it.
:'''Spike''': I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.
:'''Daisy''': Top of the morning to ya!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Is it morning? I hadn't noticed.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's not good.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''There'' you are! We've been looking all over for you!
:'''Rarity''': It turns out Pinkie may not have taken our critique of her yovidaphone playing in the spirit with which it was intended.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I saw.
:[shriveling]
:[shade closing]
:'''Spike''': There's gotta be something we can do.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm sure there is, Spike. We just have to figure out what.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs] I don't get it. So she's no good at playing the yovidaphone. What's the big deal? There are ''so'' many other things she's really good at doing.
:'''Applejack''': Yeah! Not bein' able to play the yovidaphone is nothin' compared to all the things she ''can'' do well.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And that's exactly what we'll show her! I bet if we get her to do the stuff she likes ''and'' is good at doing, she'll cheer right back up and forget all about the yovidaphone.
:'''Applejack''': Hoo-whee! That's a great idea!
:[air squeaks, hisses]
:'''Rarity''': Let's get started. Apparently, there's not a moment to lose.

:[music]
:[tea pouring]
:[clink]
:[animals chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [slurps]
:[bubbling]
:[thud]

:[weak party cannon squeak]
:[party cannon squeak]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sighs]
:[air hissing]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': [laughs, groans]

:[spraying and popping]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sneezes]
:[mirror shattering]

:'''Applejack''', '''Rainbow Dash''', '''Rarity''', and '''Fluttershy''': [sigh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, I'm guessing nopony had any success?
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] My party cannon idea was a real dud.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't blame yourself. None of us did any better.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, not to worry. I came up with the perfect solution. Instead of trying to remind her what she's good at, we'll remind her what she's ''best'' at. And that's being our friend. We're gonna throw her a Pinkie Pie Appreciation Party!
:'''Fluttershy''': That's a wonderful idea! If anypony needs to know how much she's appreciated, it's Pinkie Pie.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We can get the whole town involved, just so she can see what a good friend she is to everypony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then I hereby officially declare today Pinkie Pie Appreciation Day!
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': [cheer]

:[various party noises]
:'''Rarity''': Now ''this'' is perfection!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! If anything could help Pinkie Pie cheer up and make her forget about her yovidaphone, this is definitely it!
:'''Applejack''': Sure is! Okay, who's gonna get her?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No need. Gummy's on it. In fact, there he is now!
:[dragging noise]
:[thump]
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Uh, Gummy? You were supposed to bring Pinkie Pie. What happened?
:'''Gummy''': [blinks slowly]
:'''Rarity''': Is she still coming?
:[beat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Fluttershy, can you understand what he's saying?
:'''Fluttershy''': I could... if he was talking.
:'''Spike''': Let me try something. [slowly, loudly, and deliberately] Gummy! Where is Pinkie Pie?!
:[splat]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe we should just go and get her.

:[magic zap]
:[party horn]
:'''Applejack''': What in tarnation is goin' on here?!
:'''Rarity''': This decor is dreadful.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And all of Pinkie's stuff is... gone?!
:'''Rarity''': It is a puzzle.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Excuse me.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, yes, of course.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Um, Maud? Can I ask you a question?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You just did.
:'''Applejack''': Well, can ''I'' ask you a question?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] You just did.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] Fine! How about if ''I'' ask you a— Wait.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, for goodness' sakes! Maud. All of your sister's things are gone. Explain.
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] No, they're not. They're right here.
:'''Fluttershy''': Have you seen Pinkie Pie?
:'''Maud Pie''': Lots of times. I grew up with her.
:[cart rumbling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, let's try this a different way. Why did you pack up all of Pinkie's things?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] She asked me to.
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': What?!
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] Pinkie told me to pack up her room and take everything to the rock farm.
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': ''What?!''
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] She said she wouldn't need them since she's moving to Yakyakistan.
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': '''''What?!'''''

:'''Rarity''': Terribly sorry, Maud. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said Pinkie's [chuckling] moved to Yakyakistan!
:'''Applejack''': Uh, Rarity? She ''did'' say that.
:'''Rarity''': Uh, terribly sorry, Applejack. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said [chuckling] she did say that!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maud, I don't understand. Why would Pinkie leave Ponyville?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah! Why would she want to go live with the yaks?
:'''Maud Pie''': [deadpan] She said without the yovidaphone, her life had no meaning, and at least in Yakyakistan, she could listen to the masters play. She hoped that would give her some semblance of happiness.
:'''Rarity''': Well, no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! That will not do!
:'''Applejack''': I say we go to Yakyakistan right now and make her come back home!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We can't just march up there and tell Pinkie what to do.
:'''Fluttershy''': [tearing up] But... we didn't even get a chance to say goodbye!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, we may not be able to go to Yakyakistan and force her to come home, but we could go say goodbye... and if we happen to mention how much her friendship means to us, and how much we'd miss her if she were gone forever, and then she decided to come back home on her own...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Then what are we waiting around here for?! Let's get going to Yakyakistan!
:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': [cheering]

:'''Rest of the Mane Six''': [various yelps and whoas]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We're almost there.

:'''Applejack''': Pinkie's gotta be around here somewhere.
:'''Fluttershy''': But where?
:[distant yovidaphone playing]
:'''Rarity''': Is that...?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The music of the yovidaphone.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Are you sure? Because that actually sounds kinda... good.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I'm sure. Come on.

:[yovidaphone playing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh. Not what I expected.
:'''Yaks''': Shhhh!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, sorry.
:'''Yaks''': Shhhhhhh!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [hushed] I ''said'' I was sorry!
:'''Fluttershy''': [hushed, gasps] There she is!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gulps] [despondent] Gimme another.
:'''Yak waiter''': But pony already had twenty-five ice—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': ''I said, gimme another!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts] Pardon me!
:'''Applejack''': Excuse us.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, uh, sorry!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [despondent] I feel nothing.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe we can help with that.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [despondent] Oh. Hey. What are you guys doing here?
:'''Applejack''': Just hear us out.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We respect your decision to move to Yakyakistan.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But we just wanted to remind you how much you mean to us, and how much we'd miss you if you decided to move here for—
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [despondent] Fine. I'll move back to Ponyville.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wow. That was a lot easier than I thought. We're awesome!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pinkie, what's wrong?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [despondent] ''That's'' what's wrong. I thought coming here and listening to ''real'' yovidaphone playing would make me happy.
:[yaks applauding]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [despondent] It makes me feel worse. I'm ''never'' gonna sound like that.
:'''Yigrid''': Yovidaphone fan pony watch instrument while Yigrid visit little yak's room?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [despondent] Eh. If I can't play it, I might as well do menial chores for those who can.
:'''Applejack''': Okay, so Pinkie Pie is obviously still miserable.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, I can't bear to see her like this.
:[yovidaphone honks]
:'''Rarity''': Indeed. But what else can we do?
:[yovidaphone honks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, we've tried everything!
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe not. Look!
:[yovidaphone honking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [stifled giggling] Whoops! Sorry!
:[yovidaphone honking]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I forgot what an awful yovidaphoner I am.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Playing it makes you so happy.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [wistfully] [sighs] It sure does. I mean... it did.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Then you should never stop.
:'''Rarity''': So say we all!
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Rainbow Dash''', under: [sounds of agreement]
:'''Applejack''': Absolutely.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': But... you were the ones who told me to stop because I wasn't good.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And we were wrong.
:'''Fluttershy''': Playing makes you happy.
:'''Rarity''': And as long as it makes you happy, it doesn't matter how good you are!
:'''Applejack''': So get up there and show these yaks how it's done!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [stage whisper] I don't know if you've noticed, but the audience are all yaks, and they kind of have "issues" with things that aren't perfect! Like my playing!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Pinkie Pie, you get up on that stage and play. If these yaks don't like it, they'll have to answer to us!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well, okay... If you all say so...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [clears throat] Ladies and gentleyaks! Performing for her very first time here, let's give a big round of stomps for... Pinkie Pie!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [clears throat] Um, hi! So, uh, any yaks here from out of town?
:[yak snorts]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooookay. And a-one, and a-two, and I-kinda-remember-what-to-do... [inhales]
:[discordant yovidaphone playing]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts]
:[chicken squawks]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [gasps for breath]
:[beat]
:[yaks cheering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Uhhh, I kinda wasn't expecting this.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Me, neither.
:'''Yigrid''': [stomps] Oh, pony play good set!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You think so? Even though it wasn't perfect?
:'''Yigrid''': Yovidaphone is instrument of happiness. Playing yovidaphone make pony happy. Pony playing ''is'' perfect!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Well if ''that's'' the case, lemme play you the song I just wrote two seconds ago! It's called "I've Got the Best Most Supportive Friends a Pony Could Ever Ask For"! [aside] It's a working title.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And a-one...
:'''Applejack''' and '''Rarity''': And a-two...
:'''Fluttershy''' and '''Rainbow Dash''': And a you-know-what-to-do!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [inhales]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [dramatically] I don't know, folks. She's been in there a long time!
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Flurry Heart''': [whimpers]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for her?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't—?!
:[poof]
:'''Trixie''': Escape?!
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But if you're there, who's in here?
:[poof]
:'''Trixie''': Why, our volunteer, of course!
:'''Granny Smith''': [coughs] Crabapple surprise! You shoulda oughta ''tell'' a pony before ya go a-poofin' 'em around the stage!
:[crowd cheers]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Trixie, that was an amazing show!
:'''Princess Cadance''': Flurry Heart and I loved it! I'm so glad we decided to come. You two have a real chemistry.
:'''Trixie''': The Terrifying Trunk Escape does require a grrrreat and powerful assistant.
:'''Princess Cadance''': The way you two work together, it's like you've known each other as long as Twilight and I have.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It was pretty fun.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course it was! There's nothing better than a bond with another pony. You can share all kinds of things.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Princess Cadance''': Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [giggle]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I think we'll stick to the stage magic for now.
:'''Trixie''': The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't chant.

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Trixie''': [sighs] As much as I love my one-pony show, it's always nice to come to Ponyville and perform with my great and powerful assistant. Cadance is right. We ''do'' work well together!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Doing a show with you is almost as much fun as counseling students at Twilight's school! [gasps] Which I'm supposed to be doing right now!
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': See ya later.
:[teleportation zap]
:[door jiggles]
:[thud]
:'''Hoo'Far''': Excuse me, Ms. Powerful...
:'''Trixie''': [giggles] Usually, ponies just call me Trixie. But "Ms. Powerful" has a nice ring.
:'''Hoo'Far''': From here to Saddle Arabia, I have seen nothing that compares with your wondrous show. Uh, would you consider blessing my homeland with it?
:'''Trixie''': I ''was'' just about to set out on tour. [grunts] But Saddle Arabia is much farther than my usual route. [grunts] Ugh!
:[thud]
:'''Trixie''': [laughs] And, uh, my caravan might not be suited for an extended tour.
:'''Hoo'Far''': Mine is new and quite spacious. If it would help persuade you, I would happily trade it for yours.
:'''Trixie''': ''Trade'' it?! Heavens, no! This is more than just some great and powerful wagon you see before you! It is shelter. It is transportation. It is my only friend on the long and lonely nights on the road.
:'''Hoo'Far''': Very well. Then I must see as many of your performances as I can. If I cannot convince you to bring your tour to Saddle Arabia, I must be prepared to relate its magnificence to your many fans there.
:'''Trixie''': "Many fans", you say? [laughs] Well, I suppose I ''could'' consider the trip.
:'''Hoo'Far''': Wonderful! I look forward to seeing you on the road! And if you change your mind about the caravans, my offer remains open.
:'''Trixie''': Hmmm...

:'''Trixie''': It's just so far away. Of course, I love visiting new and exciting places. I am a ''traveling'' magician after all.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Hmmm. Sounds like your mind's made up.
:'''Trixie''': Not quite. The road is a lonely place. And this trip even more so. I was hoping I might convince my grrrrreat and powerful assistant to come along?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?
:'''Trixie''': Of course! You're not just my assistant and my counselor. You're also my friend. And what's better than a road trip with friends?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Nothing! This will be the best magical road trip ever!
:[doors open]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I should probably get somepony to cover my student counseling duties while we're gone.

:[clattering]
:[knocking]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, are you all right?
:[door opens]
:'''Trixie''': One caravan for two all set! Oh. You brought luggage. [nervous laugh] I mean, of course you brought luggage!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You bet I did! Everything two ponies need for the road trip of their lives! Three one-thousand-piece puzzles, one copy of ''Dragon Pit'' – the best board game in the history of ponies – my famous collection of campfire spices, and an inflatable raft. Did I forget something? I could pop back to the castle and grab it.
:'''Trixie''': Oh, no. It isn't that.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Yeah, maybe we don't need the raft.

:'''Trixie''': [sighs] We just needed a little great and powerful rrrrreorganization! [struggling] Now, everything... fits.. just... fine!
:[crash]
:'''Trixie''': [sighs] Who am I kidding? My wagon is too small for us. I understand if you're having second thoughts.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Second thoughts? [scoffs] Are you kidding? This wagon isn't small. It's... eh... cozy. And there's no such thing as ''too'' cozy.
:'''Trixie''': Well, all right then! I guess it's time to hit the road! [struggling] I'll... start us off...
:[crash]
:[door closes]
:[rattle]
:[poof!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [coughs] Okay. Maybe there ''is'' such a thing as too cozy.

:'''Trixie''': You're sure you wouldn't rather ride?
:[rattle]
:[poof!]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm sure.
:'''Trixie''': And you're not backing out? The two of us sleeping in that cozy caravan could get tricky.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, there's plenty of high-quality inns to stay at on the way. Don't worry about it. I'm not backing out of the greatest and most powerful road trip bonding experience two ponies could ever have.
:'''Trixie''': Well, when you put it like that, I'm actually kind of excited!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Me, too! [sighs] Thank goodness we're not like Twilight or the others. They'd probably sing a song about it.
{{#lst:We're Friendship Bound|song}}
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [laugh]
:'''Trixie''': Ooh, the marketplace. Perfect! I've learned the hard way that life on the road requires very specific supplies. And we only have so many bits. So we'll have to spend them wise...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [chewing]
:'''Trixie''': ...ly.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Sorry about wasting bits on street food.
:'''Trixie''': Oh, it's fine. Falafel bonding, right? [laughs] Besides, we still have enough for... haycakes and juice.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Um, why don't we go there?
:'''Trixie''': Oh, no-no-no. I always buy my haycakes here.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So we're just going to wait in line for hours? Uh, which is totally cool! Waiting-in-line bonding! Right?

:'''Trixie''': After our falafel purchase, we weren't able to get everything on my list. But we are definitely set for breakfast.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': And I'm sure we'll find out that waiting in that super-long line was worth it.
:'''Trixie''': A few hiccups always happen. We'll be back on the road to friendship after a good night's sleep.
:'''Mrs. Trotsworth''': We're all full!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [gasp]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, I'm sure we'll find ''some''thing.

:'''Tall Pony''': Nope.
:[door closes]

:'''Short Pony''': Sorry.
:[curtain draws]

:'''Round Pony''': All full!
:[door closes]

:'''Hoo'Far''': Ah, the Glowpaz Festival. Somnambula is no doubt filled to the brim. Luckily, travelers such as ourselves have our caravans.
:'''Trixie''': [laughs, to Starlight] You said there'd be plenty of places to stay. "Don't even worry about it," you said. Ya might've thought to make a reservation!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Um, ''I've'' been with you singing and standing in line. When would I have done that?
:'''Trixie''': I don't know. But I'm starting to think you aren't as great and powerful an assistant as I thought!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': So you just brought me along to do your legwork?
:'''Trixie''': [sighs] No. Of course not. I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated. I was really looking forward to a relaxing night in a nice room.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Me, too. But since there's literally no room at the inns, I guess it's lucky we've got the wagon.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [unenthusiastically] Sleeping-in-tight-quarters bonding.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [unenthusiastically] Yaaaaay.
:[bumping]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [grunting, groans]
:'''Trixie''': Is there something I can do to make things more ''comfortable'' for you?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You ''could'' get rid of this junk.
:[clattering]
:'''Trixie''': Yes, well, before we throw away the magical items it's taken me years to collect, we could try switching hammocks.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Fine.
:[clang]
:[birds chirping]

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [snoring loudly]
:'''Trixie''': [gasps] Hmm? [whispering] Starlight! Starlight! I think there's a wild animal outside!
:[thud]
:'''Trixie''': Starlight?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [continues snoring]
:'''Trixie''': ''Starlight!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [startled noises] What?
:'''Trixie''': I'm sorry. Your snoring is a bit, um...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Loud? [nervous laugh] Yeah, I do that. I had my village convinced we were being attacked by bears every night.
:[beat]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [laughs, clears throat] But we probably need a better solution here.

:'''Trixie''': [sleepily muttering] Ladies and gentleponies... Great and Powerful Trixie... amazing feats...
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Seriously?!
:'''Trixie''': [sleepily muttering] Prepare to be amazed...

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [munching]
:[door opens]
:'''Trixie''': [grumpily] Sleep well?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [grumpily] Sure did.
:'''Trixie''': Is, uh, that the last of the haycakes?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [chomps] Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
:'''Trixie''': It's fine.
:[juice pours]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I don't suppose there's any more juice.
:[drip]
:'''Trixie''': [glugs] Ahhh! Nah. I guess we'll have to resupply.
:[door opens]
:'''Hoo'Far''': What a glorious morning! I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to the first show of your tour!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Is he gonna be following us for the whole time?!
:'''Trixie''': I do not know.

:[crowd murmurs]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [flatly] She's been in there a long time. Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for a pony who drinks all the ''juice'' and talks non-stop in her sleep?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't...
:[poof]
:'''Trixie''': Sleep?! Because her roommate snores like an ursa major?!
:[crowd murmuring]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [flatly] But if you're there, who's in here?
:[poof]
:'''"Cortland"''': There's not much room in here!
:'''Trixie''': At least you don't have to sleep in it ''with another pony!''
:[fanfare]
:'''Hoo'Far''': [claps weakly] This show is much better in Ponyville.
:[crowd murmuring]

:'''Trixie''': Oh. Would ''you'' like the last carrot? I know how fond you are of eating the last of things.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh, no. It might make me thirsty, and we don't have anything to drink. So...
:'''Trixie''': The good news is I'm so exhausted, I could sleep through a stampede of wild boars! Which, you'll be delighted to know, is only slightly louder than your snoring.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, ''I'm'' looking forward to rehearsing the act with you all night. So diligent of you to go over it and over it in your sleep.
:'''Trixie''': [through gritted teeth] Practice makes perfect.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Not today, it didn't.
:'''Trixie''': Well, I'm sorry you're so miserable!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Really?! Because if you wanted to make things more comfortable, you could always pare down a bit!
:[poof]
:'''Trixie''': Well, since you're ''so'' concerned about space, ''you can have it all!'' I'll sleep under the stars, where at least the wild animals will be ''QUIETER THAN YOU!''
:[door opens]
:'''Hoo'Far''': I do not mean to interrupt, but it seems there is trouble on the road to friendship.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [derisive laugh] Ya ''think''?!
:[carrot incinerates]

:'''Trixie''': [gasps] Where's my wagon?!
:[door opens]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I traded it to that pony from Saddle Arabia for his. He even threw in a pair of robes.
:[dramatic sting]

:'''Trixie''': You ''what?!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I traded the old, worn-out wagon that was too small for us, for this nice spacious one that we can ''both'' enjoy.
:'''Trixie''': [stammering] Who said you could do that?!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Nopony. I just did it. [sighs] Now we both have plenty of room, and you didn't even have to give anything away.
:'''Trixie''': ''Au contraire''. I ''did'' give something away! I gave away my wagon... and my best friend!
:[clatter]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't realize you were better friends with that beat-up old wagon than you are with ''me''!
:'''Trixie''': Well, it's easy when the wagon is a better friend! It would've ''never'' traded ''you'' away!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's ridiculous.
:'''Trixie''': Oh, it ''is'' ridiculous. In fact, this whole ''tour'' is ridiculous! I don't even know why I invited you in the ''first place!''
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, maybe I should just head home!
:'''Trixie''': I think that's a very good idea! And you can take this horrible giant caravan with you!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': ''Fine!''
:'''Trixie''': ''Good!''

:[dragging]
:[thud]
:'''Trixie''': [grunting] Come on! Whoa!
:[door jiggles]
:'''Hoo'Far''': Goodness! Oh, Ms. Powerful. Eh, but where is your assistant? I had hoped providing you with a more comfortable means of conveyance would allow you to once more dazzle the crowds with mystifying feats of magic.
:'''Trixie''': Normally, that sort of flattery would suffice. But today, we must discuss your ''dishonest'' and ''unfair'' procurement of my wagon!
:'''Hoo'Far''': I desired your wagon and provided one of equal and better value in return. It seems like a perfectly honest and fair trade to me.
:'''Trixie''': Unfortunately, it is more nuanced than that!
:'''Hoo'Far''': I'm sure it is, but I am eager to set out. If you'll excuse me.
:[whoosh]
:'''Hoo'Far''': I am willing to wait as long as you are. [sips]
:'''Trixie''': Ha! We'll just see about that!

:'''Hoo'Far''': You know, even if I was willing to reverse the trade, you don't have my caravan to offer in return.
:'''Trixie''': [grumbles] Details!

:[vines snapping]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs, grunts]
:[alligator growls]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [struggling] You all seemed... a lot less threatening when there were two of us!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [gasps, yells] This place is awful! How did I not see it before?!

:[hawk cries]
:'''"Rainy Day"''': Hey! It's one of those traveling ponies!
:'''"Snow Violet"''': Your song really inspired us! We decided we need to head off on the road to friendship, too!
:'''"Rainy Day"''': It sure beats the road to deliveries!
:'''"Snow Violet"''': Yeah! Sometimes traveling together is hard!
:'''"Rainy Day"''': You reminded us we could also make it fun! Thanks again! Woo-hoo!
:'''"Rainy Day"''' and '''"Snow Violet"''': [laughing]

:[door opens]
:'''Hoo'Far''': Steaming hot beverage?
:'''Trixie''': Thank you. No.
:[rumbling]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What are you two doing?
:'''Trixie''': Taking a stand! By lying down! Not that you care, Wagon-Trader-Away-er!
:'''Hoo'Far''': I'm afraid I'm still not interested, despite your assistant's convenient appearance.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Trixie, I came back to apologize. I should never have traded away the wagon. It wasn't mine to trade. It belongs to my friend.
:'''Hoo'Far''': Hmmm. If you truly ''were'' friends, I suppose I'd be honor-bound to reverse the trade.
:'''Trixie''': Okay! Fine! We're friends! Best friends who share a deep bond who weren't prepared for the emotional challenges of traveling. Happy?!
:'''Hoo'Far''': I'm still unconvinced. Perhaps you could ''prove'' your friendship.
:'''Trixie''': How?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, we could do our friendship chant!
:[beat]
:'''Trixie''': Oh, right... Our world-famous chant of friendship that we do all the time because we're such great friends.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [out of sync] Magic, tra-magic... poof of smoke... want to wave your hooves... and tell a... little joke!
:[poof]
:'''Hoo'Far''': [coughs] That was the worst friendship chant I have ever heard! And you two were clearly making it up as you went. ''But'' only true friends would be willing to act so ridiculous for one another.
:'''Trixie''': So you'll give back the wagon?
:'''Hoo'Far''': Though I'd suggest heading back to Ponyville. I'm not sure Saddle Arabia is ready for... uh, this.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's fair.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I'm sorry your Saddle Arabian tour was ruined.
:'''Trixie''': Honestly, I don't think I could've stood one more second on the road. At a certain point, I don't even like traveling with myself.
:[door opens]
:[luggage thuds]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It is a lot harder than I thought. Still, I'm glad we tried. Mostly so we know not to do it again.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''' and '''Trixie''': [laugh]
:'''Trixie''': I think it's made our friendship greater and more powerful than ever!
:'''"Cortland"''': [grumbles] You know, there's actually ''plenty'' of room in here for one pony to nap. Is the show over?

:[bang, bang, bang]
:'''Scootaloo''': Order, order, everypony! I hereby call to order this meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club!
:[fans murmuring excitedly]
:'''Scootaloo''': First order of business – [quickly] Let's-celebrate-the-one-and-only-Rainbow-Dash-yay-she's-amazing-now-if-there's-nothing-else-that-concludes-this-meeting-of-the-Rainbow-Dash-Fan-Club-thank-you-all-for-coming-any-questions?!
:[bang]
:[confused murmuring]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Huh?
:'''Scootaloo''': Meeting adjourned!
:[door slams]
:[bang, bang]
:'''Scootaloo''': I'd like to call to order the first ever meeting of the newest and most exciting club – of which I am the president, founding, and only member – the Washouts Fan Club!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Oh, hey, Scootaloo. I was just in the neighbor— Oh! What's this? Did I interrupt your fan club meeting?
:'''Scootaloo''': Hey! What are you doin' here?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I could ask ''you'' the same question!
:'''Scootaloo''': Oh, uh, y'know... mmm... s-s-stuff. Uh, definitely not starting a new fan club or anything.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ha! It's no use pretending! I heard everything when I was outside eavesdropping, like I do for ''every'' meeting!
:'''Scootaloo''': You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, sure it ''sounds'' weird when you say it out loud. And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong, but still. Why are you starting a new fan club?
:'''Scootaloo''': I just think maybe it's time for me to explore ''other'' fan clubs.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] What is a "The Washouts"?
:'''Scootaloo''': Only the newest, and greatest, and only stunt troupe in Equestria!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Stunt troupe?
:'''Scootaloo''': How can I explain it? Like the Wonderbolts, just twenty bajillion percent cooler! [squee]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': "Twenty bajillion"?!
:'''Scootaloo''': They do all sorts of extreme stunts that focus on daredevilry and sheer guts rather than boring old flight and formation junk.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': "Boring old flight and formation junk"?!
:'''Scootaloo''': Are you just repeating everything I say?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Only because my brain feels like it's strapped to one of those rockets about to explode.
:'''Scootaloo''': So you ''do'' get it! Aren't they awesome?!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Can you believe she actually said that?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Pfft, well, yeah! Eavesdropping on every meeting ''is'' kinda weird.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool! And... And it kinda sounded like she didn't think ''I'' was cool either. But, peh, we all know that's crazy! I mean, I'm definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else. Heh. Nope. Not! At! All!
:'''Applejack''': Well, I'd understand if you were. It'd be like if Apple Bloom started lovin' bananas more than apples. [laughs, sotto voce] Y'all tell me if that ever happens, ya hear?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But what could the Washouts possibly have that I don't?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Why don't you find out?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': They're doing a show in Ponyville this weekend?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wow! They ''do'' look pretty amazing... uh, -ly ''un''amazing. [nervous laugh] Trying so hard to look amazing is what I mean.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Nice save, Twilight! [squee]

:[crowd chattering]
:'''Scootaloo''': Awww. I ''knew'' we shoulda lined up last night.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm sorry for making us late. Who would've guessed Xtreme Chocolate Airshow Cupcakes would take an x-tremely long time to bake? [slurps, chomps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Look at this! It's a total Wonderbolts ripoff!
:'''Scootaloo''': What do you mean? The show hasn't even started yet.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, but look at what we're sitting on.
:[bang, bang]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hello?! The Wonderbolts have bleachers, too! We practically ''invented'' sitting on bleachers!
:'''Rarity''': Ugh!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And look at that! Popcorn ''and'' cotton candy?! Ripoff!
:[feedback]
:[music]
:'''Scootaloo''': Huh? Yeeeeeeeaaaahhh!
:'''Announcer''': ''This is the time! This is the place! This is the team! This is... the Washouts!''
:[crowd cheers]
:[explosions]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Mmmm! Quality confetti cannon work.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs]
:'''Scootaloo''': Oh, yeah!
:'''Announcer''': ''Say it with me now, the Washouts' official motto...''
:'''Announcer''' and '''Crowd''': Leap before you look!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Scootaloo''': Woo-hoo!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Lame.
:'''Fanpony''': Oh!
:'''Announcer''': ''Remember, ponies. While they're amazingly awesome, the Washouts are highly trained professionals in protective fire-proof flight suits! Do NOT try this at home!''
:[kaboom!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Whoa. Come on, come on! She's not gonna make it!
:[clang!]
:[crowd gasps]
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That... was... ''insane!'' Woo-hoo!
:'''Scootaloo''': I told you!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I mean... [clears throat] It was pretty cool. Who are these guys?

:'''Scootaloo''': I can't just go up and talk to them.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You can if you're with me. After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless. Observe.
:[water splashing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Hey!
:[beat]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, so as a fellow aerobatic professional, I really enjoyed your show. Heh. Actually, you might recognize me since I'm a... pause for dramatic effect... a Wonderbolt.
:'''Short Fuse''' and '''Rolling Thunder''': [laugh]
:'''Rolling Thunder''': [Australian accent] Ha! Join the club.
:'''Scootaloo''': [excited noises]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': O... kay...
:'''Rolling Thunder''': No. I mean, literally. Join the club. We're called "The Washouts" because we all used to be Wonderbolts just like you. Heh. Until we "washed out".
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No way!
:'''Rolling Thunder''': Yep. [sighs] Name's Rolling Thunder. I got booted out of Wonderbolt Academy because of "flagrant disregard for hazardous weather". Pfft! If doing barrel rolls through nine hundred million volts of electricity in a raging thunderstorm is wrong, then I don't wanna be right.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Cool!
:'''Rolling Thunder''': Ha. This 'ere's Short Fuse.
:'''Short Fuse''': Ah, nice to meet you.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': What's your story?
:'''Short Fuse''': <big>''ANGER ISSUES! GET OFF MY BACK!''</big>
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uhhh... Okay. So, who's the leader?
:'''Rolling Thunder''': Only the most reckless ex-Wonderbolt of all time.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps] Lightning Dust!
:'''Lightning Dust''': Rainbow Dash!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [snarls]
:'''Scootaloo''': Scootaloo. I'm Scootaloo. Hi.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Lightning Dust! I should've known you were the brains behind a crazy idea like the Washouts! Or should I say, "lack of brains"!
:'''Lightning Dust''': [snarls]
:'''Scootaloo''': You two really know each other? Oh, my gosh! This is so cool!
:'''Lightning Dust''': Your "friend" got me kicked out of the Wonderbolts.
:'''Scootaloo''': Oh. That's, uh, less cool.
:'''Lightning Dust''': And it was the best thing that ever happened to me! Great to see you, wingpony! I heard you're a full-fledged Bolt now.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Yeah, well, I'm still—
:'''Lightning Dust''': Mad at me? Look, was it wrong of me to endanger the lives of your friends? Yeah. But, hey, now I only endanger ''these'' knuckleheads.
:'''Rolling Thunder''' and '''Short Fuse''': [laugh]
:'''Short Fuse''': [through gritted teeth] Don't call me "Knucklehead"! [laughs]
:'''Lightning Dust''': C'mon, you know you miss me. Me and her, we blew everypony out of the sky.
:'''Scootaloo''': Really?
:'''Lightning Dust''': Actually, yeah, really! All that wind was totally dangerous, but we had fun, right? Two fastest times on the Dizzitron!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': If I remember correctly, I had you beat by half a second.
:'''Lightning Dust''': Only because when ''I'' went, I cranked up the dizziness factor.
:'''Rainbow Dash''' and '''Lightning Dust''': [laugh]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, I'm glad it all worked out. Your show was pretty dynamite.
:'''Lightning Dust''': [to Scootaloo] Wanna know the secret? We basically ignore everything the Wonderbolts ever taught us about safety.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Well, we do have safety rules for a reason.
:'''Lightning Dust''': Don't listen to her, kid. All their "rules" were just ways of keeping their little club exclusive so they could feel good about themselves.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's not about making anypony feel bad. It's about finding the best flyers. The best of the best.
:'''Lightning Dust''': I started the Washouts because I believe anypony can be the best of the best. You know, Rolling Thunder is gonna be out for a while.
:'''Rolling Thunder''': Ah, during the finale, I caught the old hind leg in the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot! Patent pending.
:'''Lightning Dust''': There's a spot on the team if you wanna join up.
:'''Scootaloo''': [gasps]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I appreciate the offer, but I'm already a Wonderbolt.
:'''Scootaloo''': I'll do it! Can I do it?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, lemme think. No!
:'''Scootaloo''': [scoffs] I wasn't asking ''you''!
:'''Lightning Dust''': Awww, you're cute. But technically, you haven't washed out of the Bolts, which is kinda our thing.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And also, ''no!''
:'''Scootaloo''': Oh, what if I joined and dropped out super quick?!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's it! You're comin' with me!
:'''Scootaloo''': Where are we going?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': To hear what the actual Wonderbolts think about you joining just to drop out for the Washouts!
:'''Lightning Dust''': Say hi to Spitfire for me!

:[Wonderbolts theme]
:'''Scootaloo''': [yawns]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ever seen two simultaneous inverse displacement rolls before?
:'''Scootaloo''': [scoffs] Would've been a lot cooler if you had the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot, patent pending.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You... ''What?!'' [to Spitfire] See? This is what I was telling you about.
:'''Spitfire''': I got this. [to Scootaloo] You know what happens when something goes wrong with the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Patent pending?
:'''Spitfire''': You end up in a ''full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!''
:'''Scootaloo''': But with enough practice—
:'''Spitfire''': Practice?! Well, la-dee-''doodle-dah!'' Lemme give you a different scenario. You're probably saying to yourself, "I'm young. I'm strong. I'm gonna go out there and ''stunt'' some ''tricks'' with my new friend ''Lightning Dust''!" Well, I'm here to tell ya that if ya play ''that'' game, you're gonna find out it's pretty hard to "stunt tricks" in a ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!</span>''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I think she gets the poi—
:'''Spitfire''': ''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I'm not finished!</span>'' Listen, I get it, kid. I used to be like you, tellin' myself, "I'm gonna touch the sky!"
:'''Scootaloo''': I don't—
:'''Spitfire''': Well, whoop-dee-''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">doodle-doo!</span>'' You think you got it made in the shade? Well, things are gonna be pretty shady indeed when you can't go out in the sun, 'cause you're in a '''''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw! Do I make myself clear?!</span>'''''
:'''Scootaloo''': [shakily] Uh-huh...
:'''Spitfire''': Excellent. Have a hat.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh... Heh. Sorry that was a little... intense. I just wanna make sure you don't get hurt. That way, you can follow in my hoofsteps. Heh. Everypony's dream, right?
:'''Scootaloo''': More like "follow your wingflaps".
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Same difference.
:'''Scootaloo''': [sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what ''I'' should do.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Clearing things up is one of my specialties. Now, come on. Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club. You know, the one about me?
:[clatter]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly? [laughs] Nah! I'm just kidding.
:[blow dryer blowing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That makes me seem too egotistical, doesn't it? Oh, oh! Maybe if they're framed, it's like, "Wow, she's so humble!" Ya think? Scootaloo?
:[door opens]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, Scootaloo?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Anypony seen Scootalo—
:[bump!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ow! My fault, my fault! Sorry, I— Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [groans] Sorry. I was just... um...
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Please tell me you got that stuff so you could rip it up and throw it off a cliff.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': They were doing an autograph session before practice.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Seriously?! [groans] You haven't seen Scoot, have you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Actually...

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice! Why can't she see how dangerous they are?!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's kind of the whole draw. It's exciting.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But it's like the harder I try to convince Scoot they're dangerous, the more she likes them!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can't control her actions. Only yours. Teach her what's safe and what isn't, like a good role model. Then hope she makes the right decisions.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': But what if she chooses them over me? She's gonna get hurt!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think I know somepony else who might get hurt if ''that'' happens.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Um, maybe you're right. But this isn't about me. I'm just worried about Scoot.

:[clanging]
:'''Short Fuse''': Wow. You're really workin' hard on this new stunt. [chomps, spits] <big>''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">What kind of sorry excuse for a tomato sandwich is this?!</span>''</big>
:'''Lightning Dust''': Sorry, Dash. Autograph session's over. Unless you wanna buy Short Fuse's limited edition half-eaten tomato sandwich.
:'''Short Fuse''': <big>''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">I'm not signing that abomination!</span>''</big>
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you?
:'''Lightning Dust''': Ohhhh, isn't she that pony that used to respect you?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [growls] I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you.
:'''Lightning Dust''': [laughs] Oh, I'm pretty sure she still likes us.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [gasps]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Lightning Dust, I know we go way back, but I can't let her do this!
:'''Scootaloo''': I don't need you standing up for me!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Obviously, you do! Because you can't see how dangerous this is! Do you not remember what Spitfire said?
:'''Lightning Dust''': Ugh. Lemme guess. [imitating Spitfire] You'll be in a full-body wing-and-hoof cast '''''<span style="text-transform:uppercase;">drinkin' through a straw!</span>'''''
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That doesn't even sound like Spitfire.
:'''Scootaloo''': [laughing]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's it! We're leaving!
:'''Scootaloo''': Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to ''be'' you! But based on ''your'' definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll ''never'' be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a roaring crowd!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That was awfully specific.
:'''Lightning Dust''': That's 'cause it's what she'll be doing in the show tonight. Half off for princesses! [whispering] Bring your friends!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Scootaloo, are you sure that's what you really wanna do?
:'''Scootaloo''': Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're right. You're your own foal, and you have to make your own decisions.
:'''Scootaloo''': Good! Because I already have!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [sighs]

:[crowd chattering]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Sorry for making us late again. Who would've guessed Scootaloo's super-difficult stunt special cupcakes would've been super-difficult to bake? [chomps]
:'''Applejack''': Hoo-wee! Looks like all of Ponyville is here. Except for Rainbow Dash.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Announcer''': ''And here to introduce the most dangerous stunt we've ever performed, it's your fearless captain, L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Lightning Dust!''
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Lightning Dust''': In just a moment, the newest member of the Washouts will be rocket-sledding down that hill, up that ramp, and over all twenty-two wagons to land on the other side in one piece! Heh. If she's lucky.
:[crowd gasps]
:'''Lightning Dust''': Put your hooves together for Half-Pint Dynamite!
:[crowd cheers]
:'''Scootaloo''': Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know. So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you "ma'am"?
:'''Lightning Dust''': You land this jump, you can call me whatever you want.
:'''Scootaloo''': Wow. That sure is...
:'''Lightning Dust''': Dangerous? Nah! Well, maybe a little.
:'''Scootaloo''': Has anypony tested it before?
:'''Lightning Dust''': Where's the fun in that?
:'''Scootaloo''': [gulps]
:[tape stretching]
:'''Scootaloo''': There's m-more?!
:'''Lightning Dust''': You're not thinking of backing out, are you?
:'''Scootaloo''': No! I'm just thinking about drinking through straws.
:'''Lightning Dust''': Are you the president of my fan club or not?
:'''Scootaloo''': Of course! It's just—
:'''Lightning Dust''': You wouldn't wanna get impeached for dishonoring my wishes, would you?
:'''Scootaloo''': I... Is that a thing?
:'''Lightning Dust''': Light it up!
:[flames roaring]
:'''Scootaloo''': Okay. Now I ''am'' thinking about backing out.
:'''Lightning Dust''': Too late!
:[rockets roaring]
:[crowd cheering]
:'''Scootaloo''': [whimpering]
:[crowd gasps]
:[whoosh!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know I was supposed to let you make your own decisions, but that doesn't mean I can't swoop in and save you from time to time.
:'''Lightning Dust''': If I'd known you were gonna bail, I would've done the trick myself!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Great! So you won't mind how that rope's about to coil around your hoof.
:[snap!]
:'''Lightning Dust''': RIVALS FOR LIIIIIFE!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Wouldn't have it any other way!
:'''Scootaloo''': I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it meant I got hurt. That's ''not'' the kind of pony I wanna look up to.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ''I'm'' the one who should be apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club. I've been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest. But there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as awesome as me. I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club. Because I know a fan club that could use some new members.
:'''Scootaloo''': The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!

:[bang, bang, bang]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [clears throat] Welcome to the first ever meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously under-appreciated pony in Ponyville! With founding member and president Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the... Scootaloo Fan Club!
:[fans cheering]
:'''Scootaloo''': You know, Rainbow Dash was right. Eavesdropping on your own fan club isn't weird at all.

:[digging sounds]
:[clunk!]
:'''Rockhoof''': [grunting and laughing] You're going to have to work faster than that if you plan to dig up my whole village, lass. Let me help.
:'''Professor Fossil''': [yelps]
:[thud!]
:'''Professor Fossil''': Er... Thank you, Rockhoof, but we're trying to carefully preserve every bit of history here.
:'''Rockhoof''': Aye. This place is full of memories. Did I tell you about the time our chieftain knocked down five boulders with the kick of a wee ball?
:'''Professor Fossil''': [gasps] Stop that!
:[ball thunks]
:'''Rockhoof''': But... [stutters] That's what this is for.
:'''Professor Fossil''': Maybe in the past. [blows] Now it belongs in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched.
:'''Rockhoof''': Agh! Next you'll be sayin' I shouldn't have used the old sweat lodge.
:'''Professor Fossil''': [gasps]
:[crash!]

:'''Professor Fossil''': So, you see why Rockhoof isn't an ideal fit for my team. Perhaps you could use his, uh... unusual talents?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Of course, Professor Fossil! We'd be honored to have a Pillar of Equestria on our staff!
:'''Professor Fossil''': Oh, thank Celestia.
:[door closes]
:'''Rockhoof''': [slurps, crunch] Ugh! [spits, groans] That apple's made of wood! What a horrible trick to play!
:[whack!]
:'''Rarity''': Hmm. Has anypony seen my decorative centerpieces? They were right here.
:'''Professor Fossil''': Good luck!

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:[students chattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, join me in welcoming Professor Rockhoof to our faculty!
:[students cheering]
:'''Rockhoof''': Thank you! Thank you, all! I know I'm new to your world, but there's one thing I learned when I saved my village from a rushing river of hot lava. There's nothing you can't do with hard work. And a shovel!
:[crunch!]
:[students gasping]
:[creaking]
:[crash!]
:'''Smolder''': Except maybe stand on stage.
:'''Spike''': [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So, um... everycreature dismissed. We'll... see you in class!

:[students chattering]
:'''Smolder''': You think that new pony is gonna be the weirdest teacher at school or just ''one'' of the weirdest?
:'''Yona''': Yona like new teacher. He big like yak!
:'''Gallus''': And he smashes things like a yak, smells like a yak...
:'''Yona''': Yes! He perfect!
:'''Sandbar''': Guys, he's one of the Pillars! He's like... pony history!
:'''Rockhoof''': Hello, class!
:[crash!]
:'''Rockhoof''': Eh, um... [clears throat] I'm, uh, your new "Theory and Defense of Friendship" teacher.
:[creaking]
:'''Rockhoof''': But, uh, I haven't had a chance to look at Headmare Twilight's notes yet. What have you all been learnin'?
:'''Ocellus''':  We just studied all about how Princess Celestia and Luna used a spell to trap Discord in stone sleep for hundreds of moons.
:'''Rockhoof''': Ohhhh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! So it's a class about stories, is it?
:'''Gallus''': Stories! Yeah! And we never, ever, ever get homework!
:'''Rockhoof''': Good! The best way to teach colts and fillies is by experience. Like the time I was in the woods and I ran across an ursa major!
:'''Silverstream''': Really?!
:'''Sandbar''': We're not doing that, right?
:'''Yona''': You fight ursa major? All alone?
:'''Rockhoof''': Aye. And I defeated her, too.
:'''Smolder''': Now this I'm interested in!
:'''Yona''': How Professor Rockhoof win?
:'''Rockhoof''': Well... that's quite a tale.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': From what Professor Fossil said, it sounds like Rockhoof just hasn't settled into modern times yet. Our school is the perfect place for that. Plus, we get a new teacher.
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] This may be the fastest friendship problem you ever solved.
:[crash!]

:'''Rockhoof''': Dodge! Thrust! Shovel leap! Shovel throw!
:[crunch!]
:[thud!]
:'''Rockhoof''': Shovel whack! Now you lot be the ursa major. Lots o' growlin', mind?
:'''Gallus''', '''Yona''', and '''Silverstream''': [growling]
:'''Rockhoof''': [laughing]
:[thunk!]
:[students cheering]
:'''Applejack''': Maybe classrooms were less breakable in the old days?
:'''Yona''': Ooh-ooh-ooh! What happened next?
:'''Rockhoof''': [laughing] The huge beastie jumped out of the moonlit mist, her fearsome fangs at my throat! But I rolled clear.
:[crash!]
:'''Silverstream''': Then what?
:'''Rockhoof''': She backed me up against a wall, ready to pounce!
:[students gasping]
:'''Rockhoof''': I looked at her. She looked at me. And I say—!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh, Professor Rockhoof?
:'''Rockhoof''': Nope! Guess again! [clears throat] Uh, oops.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry to interrupt. Class, why don't we go ahead and take lunch early today? Rockhoof, can we take a walk outside?
:[students chattering]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Our school is about finding your own special way to teach.
:'''Applejack''': And we can already tell you're a... smash with the class. [chuckles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But maybe you could do a little less smashing in the class''room''?
:'''Rockhoof''': Sorry about that. I did get a bit carried away. The students were so interested in my tale. [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know it's a big change. But I think you're gonna fit in just—
:[flames roaring]
:[boom!]
:'''Rockhoof''': ''Fire!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rockhoof, wait!
:'''Rockhoof''': No time! The building's ablaze! We have to get everypony out!

:'''Yona''': Professor Rockhoof best teacher ever! [sighs] Day cannot get better.
:[crash!]
:'''Rockhoof''': Let's get you outside, wee ones!
:'''Yona''': Day just got better!
:'''Rockhoof''': [grunts]
:'''Silverstream''': [yelps]
:'''Rockhoof''': Alley-oop!
:'''Applejack''': Rockhoof?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What are you doing?!
:'''Rockhoof''': Savin' the school!
:[shatter!]
:[water splashing]
:'''Rockhoof''': Just like fightin' a volcano in the good old days!
:'''Rarity''': Would somepony kindly explain what is the meaning of all this water?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I'm not sure. But I think it's surf's up! Woo-hoo! Cowabunga!
:'''Rockhoof''': Sorry, Rarity, but I had to put out the ragin' inferno.
:'''Spike''': Inferno? Where?
:'''Rockhoof''': Did you not see the smoke and flame?
:'''Smolder''': Yeah, that was us. You know, dragons? Having a fire-breathing competition?
:'''Rockhoof''': You, uh... what?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [panting] They do it all the time. That's what we were trying to tell you.
:'''Applejack''': We know you're used to bein' a hero, Rockhoof. Only what we need here is a teacher.
:'''Rarity''': One who doesn't ruin an entire class's friendship quilts. Do you know how hard it is to stitch a pineapple pattern?!
:'''Rockhoof''': [sighs] My deepest apologies. I'm not used to living with dragons or much else in this modern time. Professor Fossil made it clear I'm not welcome back in my old village. Seems I don't belong here either.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Wheeeee!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So apparently, finding Rockhoof a new job is a lot harder than we thought. Has anypony had any luck?
:'''Rest of Mane Six''': [negative muttering]
:'''Applejack''': I-I thought you were gonna try him out at the post office.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We did.

:'''Rockhoof''': [yelling] ''Do you know where I can find Cranky Doodle Donkey?! I need to deliver his medicine! He has a rash in a very embarrassing place!''

:'''Spike''': [shudders] I did not need to hear that.
:'''Rarity''': Yup. Rockhoof's time as a spa masseuse didn't work out either.

:'''Rockhoof''': Now just let me know if this is too much pressure!
:[crunch!]
:'''Bulk Biceps''': [high-pitched shriek]

:'''Rainbow Dash''': W-Well, at least Rockhoof's really strong. Maybe we could find him a job carrying heavy stuff?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I tried that already. Zecora needed somepony to help her get supplies, but...

:[knock, knock]
:[door opens]
:'''Rockhoof''': I know you said you only needed a few leaves, but I figured why not bring you the whole thing?
:[bees buzzing]

:'''Rarity''': Oh, how horrid.
:'''Fluttershy''': None of the other Pillars seem to be having trouble fitting into the modern world.
:'''Applejack''': Then maybe they can show Rockhoof how they did it. Get him used to livin' in this time.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Great idea! Rockhoof's old friends would be happy to help. And I bet he'd love to visit them.

:'''Rockhoof''': [sighs] Even Canterlot looks different from the old days.
:'''Applejack''': Aww. I'm sure once you see your old pal Flash Magnus, you'll feel right at home.
:'''Flash Magnus''': Trot, two, three, four! Trot, two, three, four! Keep it lively, rookies! Visitors on site! Company, halt! Rockhoof, you old ditch-digger you!
:'''Rockhoof''': Flash Magnus, as I live and breathe! Is this your squadron?
:'''Flash Magnus''': After we got out of limbo, I went looking for work for a pony with experience in the Royal Legion. Once a soldier, always a soldier.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Princess Celestia was happy to find a new drill sergeant for her guard!
:'''Rockhoof''': Uh... that's great. She really put you in a job that big so soon?
:'''Flash Magnus''': Ho-ho, this is nothing. You should see what Mistmane is up to.

:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Rockhoof''': They made you the royal landscape artist for the Crystal Empire?
:'''Applejack''': Wow...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Your work is beautiful.
:'''Mistmane''': Oh, thank you. I've never worked with crystal before, but in my heart, I know I'm where I belong.
:'''Rockhoof''': You always could find the beauty in things. But there's not much demand for shovel ponies like me nowadays.
:'''Mistmane''': Don't give up hope. See Somnambula. She'll help you find your purpose.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whispering] Somnambula's a motivational speaker. Bet they didn't even have those back in your time.
:'''Rockhoof''': [whispering] Because we didn't need them. Ponies knew what to do with their lives.
:'''Somnambula''': Focus on my voice and feel yourself unlock your potential. [inhaling and exhaling] Imagine everything that troubles you as one big cloud. Now let it float away. You are relaxed. Free to do anything you wish.
:'''Rockhoof''': [snoring loudly]
:'''Applejack''': Guess he wished he could take a nap?

:'''Rockhoof''': Mage Meadowbrook, your home looks just the same as the old days. Wish I could say the same for mine.
:'''Mage Meadowbrook''': Well, I've had to expand my clinic a bit. Many creatures need healin' in this modern world. Aww. Looks like you could use some, too. What's got you heartsick, Rockhoof?
:[thud!]
:[bottles clattering]
:'''Rockhoof''': Thing is, I can't do my old job like Flash. Or adapt like Mistmane. Or succeed at something new like Somnambula. Or go home, like you.
:'''Mage Meadowbrook''': Give it time. Even Star Swirl's still learnin' about friendship.
:'''Applejack''': Yeah! And I bet Stygian took plenty o' time to fit in.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, look what I found! ''Me and My Shadow'', the third hit novel by former villain Stygian! I'm impressed! He's really thriving!
:'''Rockhoof''': [sighs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rockhoof? Where are you going?
:'''Rockhoof''': I'm not sure. Maybe I just don't belong in this modern world.

:'''Applejack''': Now this here's a right mash of apples. 'Stead of solvin' Rockhoof's problem, we made him feel even worse.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I'll tell you the real problem here. We haven't given Rockhoof the chance to be who he ''really'' is.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': A pony with a metal shovel and a heart of gold?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ugh. A hero! What we need to do is find him a job that's as epic as he is!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hmm. I might know just the thing.

:'''Rockhoof''': I'm honored to serve in the Hippogriff Navy, General Seaspray! I promise I'll prove my worth.
:'''Seaspray''': Think nothing of it. I know how hard it is to adapt to a new home. After our many years below the waves, land customs seemed strange.
:'''Rockhoof''': Like you didn't fit in, no matter how hard you tried?
:'''Seaspray''': As though the world had moved on without us. Never fear, Rockhoof. We shall be as brothers in this bright future above the waves.
:'''Applejack''': [whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Uh, why do the Hippogriffs need ships if they can turn into seaponies?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe they just like cruises?
:'''Hippogriff Sailor''': General! The fog's too thick to see our way out of the harbor!
:[water rushing]
:'''Seaspray''': Heave to, swabbies! Halt the ship and hold her 'til the fog passes!
:'''Rockhoof''': Wait, General! We can navigate the same way my Coltic ancestors traveled through the Selkie Mists! We'll look to the stars! There in the northwest sky is the constellation O'Bridle's Pelt! Steer the ship toward that!
:'''Seaspray''': You heard the pony, crew! Make full sail!
:[water rushing]
:'''Applejack''': Yee-haw! Rockhoof did it!
:[crash!]
:'''Rockhoof''': But... I don't understand! The stars have always steered me true!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, no. Stars can move slowly over time. They must look different now than over a thousand years ago.
:'''Seaspray''': It was an honor serving with you, Rockhoof. But it seems our paths lie in different directions.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, mistakes happen. We'll think of something else for you to do.
:'''Rockhoof''': Oh, there's no need, lass. I already know what I want to do next.
:'''Applejack''': Really? What?
:'''Rockhoof''': I heard there's a statue spell that sends creatures into stone sleep. I want you to cast it. On me.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [gasps]

:'''Spike''': [muttering sleepily]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No!
:'''Rockhoof''': Yes!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No!
:'''Rockhoof''': Aye!
:'''Spike''': [groans]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''No!''
:'''Rockhoof''': ''Aye!''
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Hey, guys. Need me to help you decide something?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Rockhoof wants me to cast a spell to turn him into a statue! The answer is no!
:'''Rockhoof''': Well, it should be "aye", because I wouldn't even be here to be turned into a statue if Twilight hadn't cast a spell in the first place! [stomps]
:'''Spike''': Whoa. I thought you were arguing over ice cream flavors.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The answer is still no! Why would you want to be turned into stone?
:'''Rockhoof''': Because I'm a relic of a bygone age. I belong in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched. I don't belong in this time. It's up to ''you'' to make that right.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But there has to be a better way!
:'''Rockhoof''': Twilight, please understand. I want to be remembered as the hero I was, not the disappointment I've become.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But you're not! Rockhoof, wait! Spike, can you teach my class today?
:'''Spike''': Uh, you're not really going to turn him to stone, are you?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Only because it's temporary. As soon as I think of a new solution, we'll wake Rockhoof up. I know he has more to offer the world as a pony than a statue.

:'''Sandbar''': Did you hear Rockhoof caught all the bees in the Everfree Forest and gave 'em to Zecora as a gift?
:'''Silverstream''': Wow! Terramar said Rockhoof called down the stars and sunk the whole Hippogriff Navy!
:'''Smolder''': He's definitely weird, but in a fun way. You never know what's gonna happen next with him.
:'''Yona''': Professor Rockhoof best pony!
:'''Spike''': Hey, class. Welcome to the Theory and Defense of Friendship.
:'''Gallus''': Another sub? Let me start by telling you we don't get homework and we only do field trips.
:'''Spike''': Yeeeeah. Nice try. Twilight sent me to tell you she won't be in today 'cause she has to cast a stone sleep spell on Rockhoof.
:[students gasp]
:'''Ocellus''': Like Discord?! But why?! Rockhoof isn't a bad guy!
:'''Spike''': ["I don't know" sound] Your instructions are to write an essay on heroism and what it means to you.
:'''Yona''': No!
:'''Spike''': Oh, don't worry. It doesn't have to be a long essay.

:'''Rockhoof''': Maybe like this? Or on three legs? Hmm. What will give the wee birds fewer places to, uh... decorate?
:'''Yona''': Professor Rockhoof! Dragon said you want to turn into stone! Yona not believe it!
:'''Rockhoof''': Aye, I'm afraid it's true, lass.
:'''Yona''': But... pony need finish ursa major story for class!
:'''Rockhoof''': Oh, it's sweet of you to try to get me to stay, Yona. But I'm afraid old stories like mine aren't worth anything in this day and age.
:'''Yona''': Fine! If pony no want tell Yona story, then Yona tell pony story! From class report! [reading] "When Yona come to pony school, Yona not fit in. Pony ways strange. But Yona find friends! Yona meet Professor Rockhoof! Pony brave and strong as yak! Not afraid! Hero! When Yona grow up, Yona want to be just like Professor Rockhoof!"
:'''Rockhoof''': Well, uh, since you went to the trouble of writing something that nice, I suppose the least I could do is tell you the rest of the story.
:'''Yona''': Yona tell whole school Rockhoof is best! Now all want to hear story!

:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, I have the spell. But will you please reconsider? Rockhoof?
:'''Rockhoof''': The ursa major tried to grab me by the gullet! But I ducked her claws!
:[students in awe]
:'''Rockhoof''': She had me cornered. So I look at her. She looks at me.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps]
:'''Rockhoof''': And I say, "Sorry you won't be having any dinner tonight, lass! Guess you'll just have to... grin and bear it!"
:[students laughing]
:'''Rockhoof''': And then I tossed her away with my shovel high into the sky! And she's been a constellation up there ever since! Or so I'm told. And that's the end of my story.
:'''Students''': One more story! One more story!
:'''Rockhoof''': No, no. Thank you for listening. But it's time to say goodbye.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Wait. You said there wasn't anything in this time you were good at. What about telling stories?
:'''Rockhoof''': It was just a tall tale.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': One that captured the hearts and imagination of everycreature here.
:'''Yona''': Plus, pony story super fun!
:[students cheering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': As the Princess of Friendship, I'd like to appoint you as Equestria's official keeper of tales!
:'''Spike''': Can you do that?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Eh.
:'''Rockhoof''': I, uh... That's very kind of you. But I still think these old bones are more suited to a museum display.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You are a living record of our history. Your stories can inspire and teach generations to come. If you're a statue, that's all lost.
:'''Rockhoof''': But will I ever ''really'' belong in your world?
:'''Yona''': Rockhoof Yona's friend. So Rockhoof belongs!
:'''Rockhoof''': You know... That reminds me of another story. Once, there was a small yak that knew more than a great hero.
:'''Smolder''': Hey, don't forget the dragons in this one!
:'''Rockhoof''': Aye, there were dragons. And ponies. And plenty of Hippogriffs. Plus a changeling and a griffon...

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Tree of Harmony remains one of the most powerful sources of magic known to ponydom. And though it has been at the "root" of magic and friendship from the moment it was planted, its ways are mysterious. Almost as if it has a mind of its own.
:'''Smolder''': Mind? [scoffs] It's a tree.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': A tree that grew a castle.
:'''Silverstream''': Was that before or after Discord made chocolate rain?
:'''Cozy Glow''': [whispers] After.
:'''Gallus''': I'm never gonna learn pony history!
:[school bell rings]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You can all show me what you've learned on tomorrow's test – "Friendship's Effect on the Course of Equestrian History".
:[students groan]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Remember! Study groups are both fun ''and'' effective!

:[students chattering]
:'''Sandbar''': So, who wants to study together?
:'''Gallus''': With other students? This is Equestria! If you want the real scoop, there's only one place to go. Hello, oh maaaaagical Equestrian tree! Can you tell me everything I need to know about friendship?
:[beat]
:'''Sandbar''': [groans]
:'''Young Six''': [laughing]
:[shimmering sounds]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Smolder''': The Elements of Harmony grew the Tree?
:'''Sandbar''' and '''Ocellus''': [groan]
:'''Ocellus''': No! The ''Pillars'' grew the Tree.
:'''Sandbar''': The Tree grew the Elements, and then the box with six locks.
:'''Ocellus''': But our professors found six keys and unlocked the box.
:'''Gallus''': I'm so gonna fail.
:'''Silverstream''': You guys! Check this out!
:'''Gallus''': That's a plumbing diagram on how to fix a sink.
:'''Silverstream''': [giggles]
:'''Sandbar''': What does that have to do with Equestrian history?
:'''Silverstream''': Nothing. I just can't believe that's how sinks work! Where's Yona?
:'''Yona''': [snoring]
:'''Smolder''': [laughs] Apparently, [imitating Yona] yaks no love study groups!
:'''Gallus''': Shhhh. [laughs]
:'''Yona''': [snoring] Spider! No!
:'''Young Six''': [laughing]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [giggles]
:'''Sandbar''': Hey, Cozy. What are you doing here?
:'''Cozy Glow''': I volunteered to help Professor Sparkle organize these books. So, experts on Equestrian history yet?
:'''Gallus''': I think I'd be better off studying the plumbing book. This stuff is impossible.
:[changeling zap]
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle|Ocellus}}''': Oh, come on, Gallus! With good friends and solid study habits, anything is possible!
:'''Gallus''': [laughs]
:'''Smolder''': How about you just tell us what's on tomorrow's test, professor?
:'''Rest of Young Six''': [excited chatter]
:[changeling zap]
:'''{{H:title|as Applejack|Ocellus}}''': Now, hold on a sec. I can't give y'all a sneak peek. That there wouldn't be honest.
:'''Rest of Young Six''': [laughing]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [clears throat] Golly, it's so inspiring how relaxed you all are about studying friendship, considering your disadvantage.
:'''Yona''': What cute pony mean?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Just consider where you all came from. If Sandbar hadn't sacrificed so much of his time to get you up to speed, who knows how behind you'd be?
:'''Sandbar''': That's... not what—
:'''Cozy Glow''': [to Ocellus] I mean, growing up as a love-starved changeling? [to Silverstream] Or hiding underwater from an evil king all those years? Trusting anycreature must be so hard for you. [to Gallus] And griffons never want to be around anycreature, even other griffons. [to Smolder] And dragons are so fierce compared to us. There must be days you can't wait to get away from all us cute ponies. [to Yona, imitating Yona] "Everypony know yaks think yaks are best!" Making friends with any other creature must seem like a step down. It's just so impressive how you keep trying to understand friendship, even though it isn't in your nature. Oh! I'll let you borrow my notes! It's what friends do. I'll be right back!
:'''Silverstream''': We... should... get back to studying.

:[tapping]
:[loud, echoing tapping]
:'''Gallus''': Could you stop that clicking?! I'm trying to focus!
:'''Sandbar''': Dude!
:'''Gallus''': What? We have a test. I don't know every detail about every adventure the professors went on like you do.
:'''Ocellus''': That's why we're studying together.
:'''Smolder''': Right. To help us "disadvantaged" creatures.
:'''Yona''': Yona confused. Why we all upset?
:[clang!]
:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Silverstream''': I only glanced at that plumbing book, but I'm pretty sure this isn't supposed to be here.
:'''Ocellus''': What are you doing?
:'''Smolder''': Dragon. Strange magical cave. What do you think I'm doing?
:'''Ocellus''': [grunts]
:'''Sandbar''': [startled whinny]

:[shimmering sounds]
:'''Silverstream''': Did we know this was down here?
:'''Sandbar''': I don't think anypony knows this is down here.
:[hoofsteps echoing]
:'''Illusion Twilight Sparkle''': [stilted] Welcome.
:'''Sandbar''': Headmare Twilight? Where are we?
:'''Illusion Twilight Sparkle''': [stilted] Where you need to be.
:'''Yona''': Uh, Yona confused.
:'''Illusion Twilight Sparkle''': [stilted] It is as I feared. You are not one. What has happened?
:'''Ocellus''': We were studying friendship's effect on history, but then...
:'''Gallus''': Since friendship just isn't in our nature, what's the point?
:'''Illusion Twilight Sparkle''': [stilted] You do not believe friendship is in your nature? ''That is NOT acceptable!''
:[wind whistling]
:'''Silverstream''': Our headmare is glowing, you guys. What is going on?!
:'''Ocellus''': We should probably get back to studying for the test.
:[wind stops]
:'''Illusion Twilight Sparkle''': A test. Yes. By sunrise, this door will be closed. Finish the test before then, and you may go. Fail the test, and here you will stay.
:[teleportation zaps]

:'''Sandbar''': Huh?

:'''Gallus''': Huh?

:'''Smolder''': Huh?

:'''Yona''': [shudders]

:[water rushing]
:'''Silverstream''': Ooh!
:[splash]
:'''Silverstream''': Mount Aris? Headmare Twilight sent me home? Wait. Am I suspended? Hello? Anygriff here? Hmm. They must be topside.
:[distant growling]
:'''Silverstream''': Huh? [gasps, screams]
:[magic zap]
:[splash]
:'''Silverstream''': [screams]
:[growling sounds]
:'''Silverstream''': The Storm King?! He's back?!

:'''Gallus''': Big room. No exits. Big deal.
:[shing!]
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Gallus''': Not cool! [hyperventilates]

:'''Yona''': Nothing for yaks to be afraid of. Just empty cave. Nothing in here can hurt—
:[skittering]
:'''Yona''': ...Yona.
:[spiders chittering]

:'''Smolder''': Ugh. Things like this just don't happen in the Dragon Lands. Huh?
:'''Stepford Pony 1''': ...And I told her she was the cutest pony of all ponies!
:'''Stepford Pony 2''': [to Smolder] Ohhh! Aren't you just the most adorable thing? Come join us.
:[beat]
:'''Smolder''': No. On so many levels. No.
:[screech!]
:'''Smolder''': Huh?
:'''Stepford Pony 1''': Come sit by me, and let's compliment each other!
:'''Smolder''': [groans]

:'''Ocellus''': [gasps] Why do you look like that?
:'''Changeling 1''': What do you mean? We all look the same.
:'''Ocellus''': Not me.
:'''Changeling 2''': Of course not you... your Majesty. We'll go drain the love from those pathetic ponies in Ponyville just as you ordered.
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': [whimpers, gasps] ''Nooooo!''

:'''Illusion Rarity''': Oh! Thank heavens we found you!
:'''Illusion Rainbow Dash''': There's an emergency! And we need ''you'', Sandbar!
:'''Sandbar''': [gasps] My first friendship adventure! Yes! Count me in! Oh, I've been waiting for this— Wait! The others!
:'''Illusion Rainbow Dash''': We don't need ''them''! We need ''you''! Come on!

:[shing!]
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Gallus''': Aah! Come on, Gallus. Get it together. Deep breaths. [inhaling and exhaling] Ah... Ahh... Achoo!
:[shing!]
:'''Gallus''': [panicked whimpering] Okay. If this is a test, there's got to be a way out. It's just a puzzle... that will squash you if you don't figure it out.
:[shing!]
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Gallus''': [laughs] No pressure. [exhales]
:[shing!]
:[cracking sounds]
:[shing!]
:[cracking sounds]
:[shing!]
:'''Gallus''': Oops.
:[cracking sounds]
:[shing!]
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Gallus''': [panting]
:[shing!]
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Gallus''': Hah! [grunting]
:[shing!]
:[cracking sounds]
:[thud]

:'''Smolder''': [groans] Look. I have to get out of here and find my friends. So just tell me what I have to do to pass this test. I'm not afraid of anything.
:'''Stepford Pony 2''': Um, I dunno. Seems like she's afraid to be cute and adorable, doesn't it?
:'''Stepford Pony 1''': Or maybe she's just afraid to admit she ''likes'' being cute and adorable.
:'''Stepford Pony 2''': Mm-hmm!
:'''Smolder''': Just this once. [clears throat, cute voice] May I have some tea, please?
:'''Stepford Pony 1''': Aw, but you can't have tea if you aren't dressed for it.
:'''Smolder''': Okay. But let's keep this between us.

:'''Smolder''': [slurps, giggles]

:'''Yona''': [panting]
:[spiders chittering]
:'''Yona''': Huh? [panicked grunting, screams]
:[thud!]
:'''Yona''': [screams, panting, screams, whimpers] ''Yona need help! Where Yona's friends when Yona need them?!'' [screams]
:[spider chitters]
:'''Yona''': Huh?
:[spider chitters]
:'''Yona''': Yona... no mean to scream. Yona love making friends. Spiders friends?
:[spider chitters]
:'''Yona''': Wait. What little spider say?

:[cracking sounds]
:'''Smolder''': What happened to you?
:'''Gallus''': What happened to ''you''?
:'''Smolder''': You never saw any of that. Got it?
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Gallus''': Maybe the others got out already and we're the last ones?
:'''Smolder''': [sarcastic] Yeah, that totally seems like something they would do.
:'''Gallus''': [groans] Any other dragon or griffon would save themselves and get out of this crazy cave.
:'''Smolder''': Guess we aren't just any dragon or griffon anymore.
:'''Gallus''': Guess not. You go that way. I'll check over there.

:'''Sandbar''': Wait. I really should find my friends.
:'''Illusion Rarity''': Darling, it was so ''generous'' of you to take the time to teach those other creatures about friendship.
:'''Illusion Rainbow Dash''': But if you're going to join us and do something that really makes a difference, we need to know where your ''loyalty'' lies.
:'''Illusion Rarity''': You do want to impress us, don't you, Sandbar?

:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': [crying]
:'''Smolder''': Huh? Ocellus?
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': Go away.
:'''Smolder''': We're still in those weird caves beneath the school. We've gotta get out of here. [gasps] Chrysalis! Where's Ocellus?!
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': It's me! I'm hideous! [crying]

:'''Gallus''': Hello?!
:[bubbling]
:'''Gallus''': Where are—? Whoa!
:[splash!]
:'''Silverstream''': Shhhh! The Storm King will hear you!
:'''Gallus''': The Storm King? He was defeated. We're still under the school. This is all just some crazy test.
:[growling sounds]
:'''Gallus''': Okay, that's horrifying.
:'''Silverstream''': I can't find any Hippogriffs or seaponies. They must all be captured! Gallus! Get back down here!
:[growling continues]
:'''Gallus''': It's not real.
:'''Silverstream''': Yes, it is! He's back, and I'm never gonna see another sunset or fly through a cloud bank or study plumbing! He's gonna take away everything I love! I'm gonna be trapped down here forever!
:'''Gallus''': I'm afraid of being trapped, too! I'm scared of small spaces.
:'''Silverstream''': Really?
:'''Gallus''': Yeah. And I was stuck in a room that kept shrinking. But I realized I had to face my fear, and I found the way out. This is ''your'' test. He isn't really here.
:[growling sounds]
:'''Silverstream''': But what if he is?
:'''Gallus''': Then tell him exactly what you think of him.
:[magic zap]
:'''Silverstream''': Uh, hey! Storm King! You're nothing but a big, old bully with a silly name and a goofy crown! You thought you could scare us into doing whatever you wanted! But we learned that together, we're stronger than you! And now that we're rid of you, we're gonna ''soar through the sky and go on adventures and <span style="text-transform:uppercase;">never give you another thought ever</span>!'' [stomps]
:[rocks toppling]
:'''Silverstream''': Ha-ha! I did it! I told him!
:'''Gallus''': Okay. Heh. Hug time later. W-We still have to get back to the library.

:'''Smolder''': You're a changeling. Just change back.
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': I can't.
:[changeling zap]
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': Maybe my past was so horrible, it's still inside me just waiting to come out again.
:'''Smolder''': That's ridiculous. That's not who you are anymore. You've changed.
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': Maybe we can't really change that much.
:'''Smolder''': [muffled] I like cute, silly stuff.
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': I'm sorry, what?
:'''Smolder''': I like cute, silly stuff! But ever since school started, I've realized that sometimes I kinda don't mind cute stuff.
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': [laughs]
:'''Smolder''': If a dragon like me can admit she likes tea parties, that's proof we ''can'' change. I was gonna invite you to a top-secret tea party with me, but if you want to stay down here...
:'''{{H:title|as Queen Chrysalis|Ocellus}}''': Oh! No! I want to come!
:[changeling zap]
:'''Smolder''': I thought that might work. Come on, let's go!

:'''Silverstream''': Where's Yona and Sandbar?
:'''Gallus''': The way out is closing!
:'''Smolder''': We aren't leaving without them!
:[spiders chittering]
:'''Yona''': Yona find you guys!
:'''Rest of Young Six''': [screams]
:'''Silverstream''': Hey, Yona. Who's your... spider army?
:'''Yona''': Yona always scared of spiders. But then Yona meet Spindle.
:'''Spindle''': [chitters]
:'''Yona''': Yona realize no reason to be afraid. Spiders and yak friends! So Yona ask new friends to help finding old friends!
:'''Gallus''': Do you think your new friends can help us find Sandbar?
:'''Spindle''': [chitters]
:'''Smolder''': Of all the strange things that have happened tonight, that's the strangest, right?

:'''Sandbar''': Okay, enough! I'm not going anywhere without my friends!
:'''Illusion Rainbow Dash''': So you don't care about anypony but your friends? Are you really that selfish?
:'''Illusion Rarity''': Honestly, you really are such a disappointment.
:'''Sandbar''': I've always looked up to you. You would never turn your back on each other, and that's what makes you strong. Now I have a group of friends that I think is every bit as amazing as yours. If I have to give up on them to make you proud, then you aren't the ponies I thought you were. I don't care if I disappoint you. ''You'' disappoint ''me''.
:[shimmer!]
:'''Silverstream''': Did you just tell our professors you were disappointed in them?
:'''Sandbar''': Something tells me those weren't actually our professors. Besides, they tried to get between me and my friends.
:'''Smolder''': That's all very sweet. Now, can we please get out of here?!

:[cracking sounds]
:'''Sandbar''': [grunting] You! You're not Headmare Twilight, are you?
:'''Ocellus''': [gasps] You're the Tree of Harmony!
:'''Silverstream''': The Tree of Harmony turned into a sparkly version of our headmare to talk to us? Did I miss a chapter in class?
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle|Tree of Harmony}}''': Like all living things, I change as I grow. As I have grown, so have my abilities.
:'''Gallus''': I'm a bit rusty on pony history. But since when does the Tree of Harmony trap creatures in a cave with their biggest fears?!
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle|Tree of Harmony}}''': You chose what you saw in my roots, not me.
:'''Sandbar''': [gasps] Our friendship got us past our fears!
:'''{{H:title|as Twilight Sparkle|Tree of Harmony}}''': You were more concerned with each other's well-being than your own. You were strong when your friends were weak. You let each other in and showed that you would be there for each other, no matter what. Friendship ''is'' in your nature.
:[shimmer!]
:[cracking sounds]
:'''Gallus''': W-We just learned a friendship lesson from a tree, didn't we?

:'''Cozy Glow''': You're all right! I came back with my notes and saw this and didn't know what to think!
:'''Silverstream''': We're better than all right! We just got tested by the Tree of Harmony! And we totally passed!
:'''Cozy Glow''': The Tree of Harmony? Here?
:'''Silverstream''': Yeah! Well, ''below'' here. Under the school! We found this and went down and met the Tree, and Gallus was all, [imitating Gallus] "Friendship is not in our nature." And the Tree was like, "Whaaaaat?!" And it tested us!
:'''Smolder''': Long story short, friendship ''is'' in our nature. The Tree said so.
:'''Ocellus''': I guess we should tell somepony there's a giant magical hole in the library.
:[clang!]
:'''Ocellus''': Or not.
:'''Sandbar''': We have to tell our professors about this! They won't believe that—!
:'''Cozy Glow''': You can't!
:'''Yona''': Why no?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Because... it's my fault. You were all getting along so well, and I felt left out. I was jealous. And it upset you so much, the Tree of Harmony had to test you. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna get expelled for sure! [crying] Please don't tell anypony about this! Especially the professors! Please, please, please—!
:'''Smolder''': Okay! [yawns] I'm actually too tired to do anything right now.
:'''Sandbar''': Yeah, but we can't go to sleep. We'll miss the test.
:'''Gallus''': [yawns] The test! I almost forgot!
:'''Ocellus''': [yawns] We're all gonna fail.
:'''Silverstream''' and '''Yona''': [snoring]
:'''Cozy Glow''': What if I tell Professor Sparkle I needed help organizing these books, and you were all kind enough to pitch in? I'll get you an extension!
:'''Sandbar''': [yawns] Thanks, Cozy. That's nice of you.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I'm just so sorry I caused all of this. You're such good friends. I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
:'''Silverstream''': [sleepily] Mmm... No problem... Friendship is... [snoring]
:'''Cozy Glow''': You get some rest. Don't give any of this another thought. Just let Cozy take care of everything.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe you two are going on a friendship quest! This is amazing!
:'''Applejack''': What do you mean, Twilight? We've been on one together before.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Exactly! This is the first time the map has teamed up the same ponies for a second quest!
:'''Fluttershy''': That ''is'' special.
:'''Applejack''': Heh. Must be 'cause we're extra good at solvin' friendship problems.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I hope so, 'cause it looks like this one might be a little tricky. You're going to the Peaks of Peril.
:'''Fluttershy''': The Peaks of... P-P-Peril?!
:'''Applejack''': Aw, it's just a name. It doesn't mean anythin'.
:'''Fluttershy''': Like how Cloudsdale is in the clouds and the Crystal Empire's made of crystal?
:'''Applejack''': Fair point. So, what can ya tell us about the place, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Only what Rockhoof told me. Back in his day, nopony knew much about the Peaks of Peril except for the legend on this ancient shield. It says a group called the Kirin used to live there, known for their kindness and truth-speaking.
:'''Applejack''': Now we know why the Map called ''us''.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Unfortunately, other creatures also lived there. The Nirik, fearsome beasts of pure fire.
:'''Fluttershy''': [shudders] Maybe you should go instead of me, Twilight. [laughs nervously]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Sorry, Fluttershy. Flanks don't lie.
:[shimmering]
:'''Applejack''': Aw, I'm sure the two of us'll get that friendship problem solved, no matter what kind o' creature has it.
:'''Fluttershy''': [laughs nervously]

:[brakes hiss]
:[train chugging]
:[wind whistling]
:'''Applejack''': Guess nopony else is goin' out as far as we are.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe they know something we don't?
:'''Applejack''': Now, Fluttershy, I've told you a dozen times. There's nothin' to be sca—
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': [screams]
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [scream]
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': I'm sorry.
:'''Fluttershy''': [screams] You really startled us.
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': Oh, it's just that I'm not used to seeing anypony taking the train to... [ominously] the end of the line. The final destination. The last stop!
:'''Applejack''': We get the picture. Why?
:'''"Loose Tracks"''': Nothing but uncharted terrain and wild beasts out that way. [maniacal laughter]
:'''Applejack''': Well, maybe there's a ''little'' somethin' to be scared of.

:'''Applejack''': Yah!

:[squishing]
:[Fly-ders buzzing]
:'''Applejack''': [groans]

:[rocks crumbling]

:[rustling]
:'''Applejack''': [panting] Those must be the Peaks of Peril. Whew. Tough goin', huh, Fluttershy—? Fluttershy? [groans]

:'''Applejack''': Yah! [grunts]

:[squishing]
:[Fly-ders buzzing]
:'''Applejack''': [groans]

:'''Applejack''': [pants]
:[splash!]
:[squirrel chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': There. That should be enough flowers to keep your tree cozy.
:'''Applejack''': Fluttershy! What are you doin'?! This is no time for visitin' varmints! We're on a friendship quest, remember?!
:'''Fluttershy''': Yes, but actua—
:'''Applejack''': Come on! We're burnin' daylight!
:'''Fluttershy''': I know, but what I found out is that—
:'''Applejack''': Now, we gotta get up that peak! I figure if we use some rope and elbow grease, we can make it up half—
:'''Fluttershy''': ''Applejack! Can you please listen to me?!'' [clears throat] What I'm trying to say is the squirrels told me a shortcut they take to the Kirin village.

:[grinding]
:[rustling]
:'''Applejack''': Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, Fluttershy. I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure.
:'''Fluttershy''': That's all right. If you hadn't come back to get me, I probably would've talked to the squirrels all day. Heh.
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [gasp]
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles]
:[rustling]
:'''Fluttershy''': I hope that's not a Nirik! [gasps]
:'''Applejack''': Show yourself!
:'''Fluttershy''': [shudders]
:'''Applejack''': Well, hi. I'm Applejack, and this here's Fluttershy.
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': If you have any friendship problems, we're here to help.
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Huh. [to Fluttershy] Quiet bunch, ain't they? [clears throat] We're from Equestria, and we're plumb tickled to meet y'all.
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': S-So, uh... what are your names?
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': [stressing] Ap-ple-jack! Flut-ter-shy! Remember?
:'''Fluttershy''': [whispering, to Applejack] Maybe they don't understand us.
:'''Applejack''': [stressing] Do. You. Un-der-stand. Ponish?
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh! But you don't speak?
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Don't or won't?
:'''Fluttershy''': Will you excuse us for a moment? [to Applejack] You have to ask yes-or-no questions, or they won't answer.
:'''Applejack''': Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?
:'''Fluttershy''': Not exactly. I can always tell what Angel is feeling. But these Kirin don't show anything.
:'''Applejack''': Well, how are we gonna solve a friendship problem if none of 'em will tell us what it is?

:'''Applejack''': These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall. Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak. [chuckles] Beautiful day, ain't it?
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': [whinny] Knock, knock! Now you say, "Who's there?"
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Police. "Police who?" Police [please] say somethin'!
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Uh-oh! I feel a sneeze comin' on! Aaaa-CHOOOOO!
:[beat]
:'''Fluttershy''': Gesundheit.
:'''Applejack''': [groans] Don't any o' y'all talk?!
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Now we're gettin' somewhere.
:'''Fluttershy''': A dark spooky path that leads into unknown territory?
:'''Applejack''': Tell you what, sugarcube. You stay and see if you can get anythin' outta these here Kirin. I'll go and try to find one that talks.
:'''Fluttershy''': Phew! Be careful. And watch out for Niriks!

:[rustling]
:'''Applejack''': [yelps] Phew! [yelps] Oh. Have you seen a Kirin that talks?
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Any idea where I should look?
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': Oh, for the love of Celestia! Can't ya just say ''somethin'<nowiki />''?!
:'''Autumn Blaze''': [giggles] Gotcha! Sorry, sorry, but that was too good. Oh, you don't know how much I missed jokes. Hi-larity! Am I pronouncing that right? Some words I haven't said in a will. While! While. Hi, I'm Autumn Blaze. You've just arrived, and perhaps you're tired or hungry or reflective and want to sleep and eat and journal? Which you should do, of course! But first— Oh! Oh, what joy to talk with another creature! It's been so long! You must tell me everything about you! There's so much to say, so much to do! Oh, look at me. I'm going on, and you haven't seen— I mean, have you seen—? W-What am I saying? Of course you haven't. So just— I— yeah— I will j— Follow me!
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': That... was somethin', all right.

:[wind whistling]
:'''Applejack''': Oh, wow. [gasps] This... is amazin'.
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Oh, you think so, too?! The way the light shimmers off everything, like, like it all suddenly woke up the moment you saw it. And you realize maybe the water and the mountains and the forest and the... yes, the rainbow and the stars and the sky are all looking back at you thinking the same thing? That we are a part of the everything. That maybe there's just ''one'' thing and we are ''all'' it.
:[beat]
:'''Applejack''': I was gonna say it's pretty. But yeah.
:'''Autumn Blaze''': [hums, sniffs] Mmmm! And this is just the first stop on a journey of amazing things to see, smell, tiptoe through. Oh, I haven't been able to share all of this with anypony in forever! Since they all took that vow of silence. So it's a lot for me to pro-cess. Process? Uh, deal with.
:'''Applejack''': Whoa there. Vow of silence?
:'''Autumn Blaze''': That's, uh... That's why they asked me to leave.
:'''Applejack''': I hope it's not a sore subject, but... you mind explainin' why y'all went quiet in the first place?
:'''Autumn Blaze''': It's a long story.
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] You'd rather not talk about it?
:'''Autumn Blaze''': No.
:'''Applejack''': I-I under—
:'''Autumn Blaze''': [begins singing] I'd rather... siiiiiiiiiiiing!
{{#lst:A Kirin Tale|song}}

:'''Applejack''': [gasps] I can't believe it! Nopony should give up feelin'... their feelin's just to keep from gettin' angry!
:'''Autumn Blaze''': That's what I said! You know, after I started talking again.
:'''Applejack''': [gasps] I bet this here's the problem that Fluttershy and I came to help y'all with!
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Really? Who's Fluttershy? Oh! Did you name your shadow? Mine's called "Silhouette Gloom of the Sundown Lands".
:'''Applejack''': Right... Well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like. Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure.
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Oh, just one small thing. The antidote from my anecdote? It's gone.
:'''Applejack''': There's no cure left?!
:'''Autumn Blaze''': I used the last of the foal's-breath flowers to make it. And I-I haven't seen them bloom since.
:'''Applejack''': [sighs] Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy. I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!
:'''Autumn Blaze''': You know, between you and me, I'm not sure she's gonna convince them. [deep voice] Nope! [normal voice] But... [whispering] I hope she does.

:'''Applejack''': [panting] Fluttershy! Guess what!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': I figured out the friendship problem! Me, too! Go ahead! [laugh]
:'''Applejack''': Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggles] No.
:'''Applejack''': Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again.
:'''Fluttershy''': Oh, no-no-no-no-no! We can't ''ever'' let that happen!
:'''Applejack''': I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem. Was somethin' lost in translation?
:'''Fluttershy''': The Kirin are usually peaceful and kind. But when they get mad, they turn into Niriks, creatures made of fire and vengeance!
:'''Applejack''': Heh. That seemed less scary when it was in a song.
:'''Fluttershy''': The last time they all argued, they got so angry, they accidentally destroyed their whole village. So the Kirin decided to make sure it would never happen again.
:'''Applejack''': But that's no reason to stop talkin'.
:'''Fluttershy''': Yes, it is! Fire is dangerous, especially in a forest like this. Why, think of all the animals it could hurt.
:'''Applejack''': Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.
:'''Fluttershy''': And how can you be sure that won't happen?
:'''Applejack''': There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!
:'''Fluttershy''': Applejack! You're not listening!
:'''Applejack''': 'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, what are they doing?
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [yelp]
:'''Fluttershy''': [grunts] Maybe they got worried because we were arguing with each other.
:'''Applejack''': Aw, shucks! We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement! Honest!
:'''Fluttershy''': W-Where are they taking us?! [grunting]
:'''Applejack''': To the Stream of Silence! If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [gasp]
:'''Autumn Blaze''': [distorted] ''Put them down!''
:[flames roaring]
:'''Fluttershy''': [whimpering]
:'''Applejack''': It's all right. I think I know this one. And she's tryin' to help.
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Well, yeah! Can't have them silence the only friend who'll speak to me.
:'''Fluttershy''': She talks?
:'''Applejack''': You have no idea. Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.
:'''Fluttershy''': Well, thank you for that... um, wall of fire. But I thought Niriks were dangerous when they're angry. How did you know you could control your temper?
:'''Autumn Blaze''': I didn't. Huh. I guess anger's like other feelings. It's not about having them. It's what you do with them.
:'''Applejack''': And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.
:'''Fluttershy''': I never thought of it that way. I can't imagine not being able to talk to my animal friends.
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Fern Flare, you used to love to laugh at everything. And Rain Shine, you sung the most beautiful harmonies. Don't you miss it?
:'''Applejack''': I know you're worried about fightin'. But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.
:'''Fluttershy''': Everypony gets mad sometimes. Even Applejack and I argue.
:'''Applejack''': What?! When do ''we'' ever argue?
:'''Fluttershy''': [clears throat] On the way here? ''And'' about the Kirin being silent? ''And'' right now!
:'''Applejack''' and '''Fluttershy''': [growl, laugh]
:'''Applejack''': We don't always see eye-to-eye. But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.
:'''Fluttershy''': And if you're really angry, then take some time away to be a Nirik where it won't hurt anypony.
:'''Applejack''': I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Okay, are you hungry? Oh, no. Is some Kirin trapped in a well? Okay, "baby". "Baby fish". "Ba"— "Ba"— No. "Baby fish mouth"? Uh, something? Anything?! [groans] Just write it down! [groans] This is making me furious. Would you excuse me? I'll be right back. [distorted scream] You were saying?
:[beat]
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Ohhhh! You want the cure for the Stream of Silence!
:'''Fluttershy''': That's wonderful! Uh, isn't it?
:'''Applejack''': Well, it would be. Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure.
:'''Fluttershy''': Are you sure?
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Oh, beyond sure. Believe me, I've had a lot of alone time lately. I searched the entire forest seventy-three and a half times. Although I wonder if that second half could make a difference.
:'''Fluttershy''': Hmm. I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.
:'''Applejack''': They're called foal's-breath.
:'''Fluttershy''': I've never heard of that.
:[squirrel chittering]
:'''Applejack''': Uh, Fluttershy? A little help?
:[squirrel chittering]
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] He says he knows where to find foal's-breath!
:'''Applejack''': Well, what are we waitin' for? Lead the way!

:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] ''That's'' what foal's-breath looks like?!
:'''Applejack''': Autumn Blaze never would've made it past the Peaks to search here. I owe you an apology.
:'''Fluttershy''': Why?
:'''Applejack''': 'Cause if your kindness hadn't made you stop to help the squirrels, we never would've found this here flower.
:'''Fluttershy''': And if your honesty hadn't convinced the Kirin to talk, we wouldn't need to find it.
:'''Applejack''': [chuckles] Guess it's a good thing the map sent both of us, huh?

:'''Autumn Blaze''': [gasps] You found them?! Where were they?! Tell me everything, and feel free to add complicated descriptions and comedic tangents!
:[beat]
:'''Autumn Blaze''': Oh. Right. First things first.
:[shimmering]
:[Kirin laughing, cheering, singing]
:'''Rain Shine''': Autumn Blaze, you have given us a gift. The realization that anger is within us, but it is our choice ''how'' we let it out. We would very much like it if you came back to live with us. I can't say how much we've missed your beautiful voice.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Woo-hoo-hoo!
:'''Spike''': Whoa! Ta-da!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay, Spike. Now let's try a flip. Remember – two flaps, then straight up!
:'''Spike''': Got it!
:[flapping]
:'''Spike''': [grunts]
:[splash]
:'''Spike''': [inhales]

:[flapping]
:[bump]
:[thud]

:[crash]
:[fwip]
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': You're doing great, Spike. Now let's see the big finish!
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:[sloop!]
:'''Spike''': Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
:[crash]
:'''Spike''': [grunts] I don't know about "big", but I am definitely finished.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe I should get Rainbow Dash. She's the one who taught me advanced flying techniques.
:'''Spike''': No, thanks. If I'm gonna mess up, I'd rather do it in front of you. I just don't understand why none of your advice is helping.
:'''Smolder''': Because she's teaching you to fly like a pony instead of a dragon.
:'''Spike''': What's the difference?
:'''Smolder''': Well, we don't have feathers, for starters.

:'''Spike''': Ye-he-he-hes!
:[hoof-bump]
:'''Spike''': Wow! Thank you so much! How did you know I just needed to bend my wings?
:'''Smolder''': Honestly, this is Dragon 101. Usually dragon parents teach this stuff.

:[knock, knock]
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, I've been thinking about our flying lesson.
:'''Spike''': Uh-huh...
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I can't believe I overlooked something as simple as feathers. It's no wonder you were having trouble. I wish I had more "dragonish" knowledge to give you. Do you think being raised by ponies has affected you in other ways? Spike?
:'''Spike''': Did you say something, Twilight? Sorry. I'm just finishing up this "thank-you" throw pillow for Smolder. And you know how I get when I'm in the embroidery zone.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [chuckles]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Spike''': It's a pillow! But not for your head. Although it could be. It's a throw pillow. They're more casual. You can use 'em anywhere. You don't like it.
:'''Smolder''': Uh, it's not that. It's just dragons don't really use pillows. At all.
:'''Spike''': What?
:'''Smolder''': Hey, what's that?
:'''Spike''': I don't know. But it's... heading right for us!
:[crash!]
:'''Spike''': Okay. Now I really owe you for the lesson.
:'''Sludge''': [groans, chuckles] Hey there, young dragons. [coughs] Name's Sludge. How are yours tails shakin'? [groans]
:'''Spike''': You all right?
:'''Smolder''': Yeah. What happened?
:'''Sludge''': To what?
:[thud]
:'''Sludge''': Oh. I don't need to explain myself to a couple of baby dragons. [groaning and whimpering]
:[thud]
:'''Sludge''': Ow...
:'''Spike''': Maybe not. But you're hurt and need help. So I'm taking you to Twilight's castle whether you like it or not?
:'''Sludge''': Castle, eh? [groans]

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm glad Spike brought you here, Sludge. I understand you made quite the impression in town.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Literally! There's a hole and everything!
:'''Sludge''': Well, I hope you're not expecting me to fix it. [groans]
:'''Applejack''': It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.
:'''Sludge''': I'll manage. Dragons take care of themselves. I don't need help from a bunch of castle-livin' ponies. [whimpers]
:'''Rarity''': Darling, do be careful.
:'''Sludge''': I'm... [groans] ...fine.
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': I can't watch!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met, you know?
:'''Spike''': And sometimes, even dragons need help.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I promise. My friends and I will only do enough to get you back on your claws.

:[montage music]
:[sewing machine whirring]

:[cider press whirring]
:'''Sludge''': [sighs]
:[crash!]

:[doors creak]

:'''Sludge''': [sniffs]
:[clang!]
:[thud]
:'''Sludge''': [chewing noisily]
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [cheer]

:'''Sludge''': [chomp]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I know you had your reservations, but it's good to see you feeling better.
:'''Sludge''': T-Thanks, I guess.
:'''Rarity''': That's what friends are for, darling.
:'''Sludge''': You're pretty lucky to have friends like these, kid.
:'''Spike''': Actually, I was orphaned as an egg, and Twilight raised me. So these ponies are more than my friends. They're my family.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We try our best, but sometimes I worry that maybe Spike is...
:'''Spike''': Missing something deep down and dragonish.
:'''Sludge''': Really? Wow. I-I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that.
:'''Applejack''': Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?
:'''Sludge''': I wasn't gonna say anything since your life seemed so perfect, but I have a confession to make. Coming to Ponyville wasn't an accident. I was looking for you. Spike... [sighs] I'm your father.
:'''Mane Six''': [gasp]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [continues gasping] Sorry.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': So you crashed in Ponyville on purpose?
:'''Sludge''': Well, the crash part wasn't on purpose, but heading here was. I've been searching everywhere for you, kid.
:'''Spike''': Did you ask in the Crystal Empire? I'm kind of well-known there.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Actually, Spike's well-known everywhere. Not a lot of dragons were hatched by the Princess of Friendship.
:'''Applejack''': Mm-hmm.
:'''Sludge''': [choked up] You make it sound so simple. I wish you'd been there to help me search.

:[doors open]
:'''Spike''': I can't believe it. I have so many questions.
:'''Sludge''': Well, ask away. Answering questions is what dads are for.
:'''Spike''': I guess my biggest question is simple. Why was I an orphaned egg?
:'''Sludge''': [stammers] You sure you don't want to ask something else? [choked up] It's a lot of painful memories. [sighs] Your mother was the best dragon I'd ever met.

:'''Sludge''': [voiceover] The Dragon Lord even picked her to scout for the Great Migration, and-and even though she just laid your egg, we knew she'd have to go. But finding the Migration route could take a lifetime, and you deserved a chance to know your mother. So I went looking for you, carrying your egg to places no dragon or pony has ever been. Past Mount Aris, the abandoned home of the Hippogriffs...

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Ooh! Did you visit Klugetown?
:'''Sludge''': You've been to Klugetown?
:'''Mane Six''': [various affirming]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Also, the Hippogriffs returned to Mount Aris after we helped them defeat the Storm King.
:'''Sludge''': Oh, well, have you heard of the Land of the... Scale Collectors?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Uh-uh.
:'''Sludge''': [to Spike] Because that's where your mother's trail finally led.

:'''Sludge''': [voiceover] To a prison world of dragon hunters, where I was forced to choose between surrendering myself or surrendering your egg.
:[clang!]
:'''Sludge''': [voiceover, choked up] Of course, there was no way I was gonna sacrifice my boy. So they took me instead, and that's where I'd been ever since.

:'''Sludge''': Locked up somewhere not even the Princess of Friendship has heard of.
:'''Spike''': Whoa... How did you know I was a boy?
:'''Fluttershy''': Whatever happened to Spike's mom?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': And how did the egg make it all the way back to Equestria by itself?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hmm?
:'''Sludge''': I wish I had all the answers. [crying]
:'''Spike''': Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together. And I'm gonna make up for lost time.

:'''Spike''': I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?
:'''Sludge''': Mind? Spike, my boy, with you by my side, I feel like we could do anything. What do you want to do first?
:'''Spike''': Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time.
:[scroll unrolls]
:'''Sludge''': Dude, you want to do all of this?
:'''Spike''': Oh. I mean, w-we don't have to.
:'''Sludge''': If you think doing everything on this incredibly long list is gonna fill the hole where your dragonishness should be, then that is exactly what we're gonna do!
:'''Spike''': [gasps]

:[montage music]
:'''Granny Smith''': [blows whistle]
:'''Sludge''': [chomp, belches fire]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Woo-hoo!
:'''Spike''': Oh, yeah!

:[wind whistling]
:[paper tearing]
:[paper tearing]

:[oven timer rings]
:'''Sludge''': [chewing noisily]

:'''Sludge''': [gulps]
:'''Spike''': I can't believe we got so many things done. But this is all ''my'' stuff. Is there anything ''you'' always wanted to do with ''me''?
:'''Sludge''': Not really.
:[beat]
:'''Sludge''': Uhhh, I mean, uh, I'm happy to do whatever you want. But if I had a castle like this with all this stuff, I'd probably just lay around all day doing nothing like a real dragon.
:'''Spike''': Like a real dragon?
:'''Sludge''': Sure! I'm not surprised you don't know any better. Twilight basically raised you as a pony. You're barely a dragon at all.
:'''Spike''': Huh?

:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Hey, Spike! How are things going with Sludge?
:'''Spike''': Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish. But I kind of feel less.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could help.
:'''Sludge''': Awww, shucks. [chewing noisily] I guess I shouldn't have said anything about you being more pony than dragon. I just wish we had more in common.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe you two can come up with ways to turn up Spike's, uh, dragonishness.
:'''Spike''': You think that's something we can do?
:'''Sludge''': You know what, son? I think it is!
{{#lst:Just Can't Be a Dragon Here|song}}

:[knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike? I just thought I'd check to see if you and Sludge had any luck turning up your dragonishness. It's hard not to feel like somehow I let you down all these years.
:'''Sludge''': [grunting]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to barge in on ya!
:'''Sludge''': [grunts, sighs] Ah, don't worry about it. ''Mi'' castle ''es su'' castle.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Right. Well, I'll just get out of your way.
:[door closes]
:[squeak!]
:[splattering]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh! Spike! I'm so sorry. My morning is not going well. What is all this? Why'd you leave the castle so early?
:'''Spike''': I didn't leave. I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Outdoors?
:'''Spike''': Yeah! And Sludge asked me to bring him the best breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon would eat it. See you later!
:[door closes]

:[doors open]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ...And that's why I thought we could use the map to—
:'''Spike''': Hey, gang! Dad was just showing me how a real dragon would act in a throne room.
:'''Sludge''': Dragons like to sprawl when they get their claws done. [blows] Now, if you'll all excuse me, it's time for my bath.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] Isn't he the best?
:'''Rarity''': I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.
:'''Sludge''': Uh, Spike? The bath isn't gonna fill itself, son.
:'''Spike''': Be right there... Dad.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm glad you're not spending the night outside again.
:'''Spike''': Oh, I am. I'm just looking for a good bedtime story to read to my dad first.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It's nice that you have somepony to show you dragon culture. But are you sure that's what Sludge is doing?
:'''Spike''': What do you mean?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Well, taking over your room, making a mess of things...
:'''Spike''': [scoffs] That ''is'' dragon culture.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''You'' never acted like that.
:'''Spike''': That's because ''you'' raised me. Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I don't think you're supposed to be any different than who you are.
:'''Spike''': Maybe you just don't like that I have a ''real'' parent now.
:[cracking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's not true! I'm glad Sludge is here. I-I just wish he wasn't such a—
:'''Spike''': Dragon? Of all ponies, I can't believe ''you'' would have a problem with that.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]

:[splashing]
:[bushes rustling]
:'''Smolder''': What happened to you?
:'''Spike''': Just sleeping outside like we're meant to. It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.
:'''Smolder''': I... guess not. But I live in the school. Nothing says we ''have'' to live outside.
:'''Spike''': [sighs] I'm so confused. It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it.
:'''Smolder''': What do you mean?
:'''Spike''': She can't handle how good at being a dragon Sludge is. Maybe someday, I'll be able to lay around doing nothing as well as he does.
:'''Smolder''': What?
:'''Spike''': Well, not now, of course. I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it.
:'''Smolder''': So, Sludge just lays around while you wait on him claw and tail? Uh, dragons are rude and rebellious, but they aren't lazy lumps who take advantage of their kids.
:'''Spike''': Huh. Now I'm really confused.
:'''Smolder''': Me, too. Why don't you tell me everything Sludge said about being a dragon?

:[door opens]
:'''Sludge''': [chewing noisily] Hey! What's going on, son?
:'''Spike''': Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out.
:'''Sludge''': [coughs] You what?!
:'''Smolder''': Spike! I found the perfect cave where you two can live! There aren't even any comfortable rocks inside!
:'''Spike''': That does sound perfect!
:'''Sludge''': No, it doesn't! I-I-I mean, uh, I'm not sure I fully demonstrated all the ways a dragon would live here.
:'''Spike''': But we're not gonna live here anymore, so it doesn't matter.
:'''Sludge''': It matters to me! [stammers] I want to make sure you have all the knowledge you need.
:'''Spike''': But I do. Dad, you've already shared so much.
::[singing] This bed is much too soft
::Just take that silk robe off
::We can't be dragons living here
:'''Sludge''' and '''Spike''': [straining]
:'''Sludge''': Stop! I'm not your father!
:'''Spike''': What?
:'''Sludge''': I just said that to get in on this sweet castle life.
:'''Spike''': So... you... pretended to be my dad?
:'''Sludge''': Now-now-now-now-now, don't look at me like that, kid. I did what any dragon would do.
:'''Smolder''': No. You didn't.
:'''Sludge''': Hey. I saw an opportunity, and I took it. ''That's'' what dragons do.
:'''Smolder''': ''No''. It ''isn't''.
:'''Sludge''': You know what? I don't need this. I'm out of here! Enjoy lovin' pony town!
:'''Spike''': [sighs]
:'''Sludge''': I'm taking this pillow.
:'''Spike''': I can't believe I thought somepony like that could show me how to be anything.
:'''Smolder''': Uh... it must be hard growing up not really knowing who you are.
:'''Spike''': That's the thing. I know exactly who I am. And how I got that way.

:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': Um, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh. Hi. Where's your father?
:'''Spike''': He's gone. Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all. He also wasn't my real dad.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Oh, Spike. I'm so sorry.
:'''Spike''': ''I'm'' the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I have to say, I'm not surprised. There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more time in the Dragon Lands.
:'''Spike''': I don't think so. I already know who my real family is.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Aww! It's me, right?
:'''Spike''': Mm-hmm! Besides, there's no way I'm living without pillows.

:'''Derpy''': [groans]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Thank you for the mail delivery. Have a wonderful day!

:'''Cozy Glow''': You're new here, right? I'm Cozy Glow, Professor Sparkle's friendship assistant. Welcome to our school! Your first class is just down that hall.

:'''Cozy Glow''': A seven-letter word for "teamwork". Have you tried "synergy"?
:'''Silverstream''': That's it! Thanks, Cozy!
:'''Cozy Glow''': What are friends for?

:[door opens, closes]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Good morning, Professor Sparkle!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The mail's here already? What time is it?! I'm late for my class's field trip to Cloudsdale! [panting]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Don't worry. I asked Professor Rainbow Dash to cover for you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': And she said yes?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Uh-huh. I told her how busy you are and how much her loyalty meant to you. I also color-coded your teaching schedule by friendship element and catalogued all the magical artifacts in the school. I hope that's okay.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay? Cozy, that's amazing! You're like my right-hoof pony! I don't know what I'd do without you.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [giggles] It's like you taught me. Helping is what friendship's all about.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Exactly. And hopefully my class is learning that on their field trip right now.
:'''Cozy Glow''': I heard they might do some sightseeing first.

:[thunder and lightning]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ta-da! The Pegasus Weather Factory! Every drop of rain or flake of snow from Cloudsdale comes from there.
:[sounds of awe]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I know, right? Hey! The cool stuff's over here!
:'''Ocellus''': Wow! I've never stood on a cloud before!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': You can't normally. But for our trip, I cast a spell that lets us walk like Pegasi.
:[wind whistling]
:'''Gallus''': Hey, Yona! Come check out this view! Unless you're too scared.
:'''Yona''': [teeth chattering] Yona not scared! [screams] Now Yona scared!

:[ponies screaming]

:'''Ocellus''': It's okay, Yona! You like flying, remember?
:'''Yona''': Flying, not falling!
:[thud]
:'''Yona''': [kissing sounds]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I don't understand. It-It's like my spell stopped working. That's... never happened before.

:[door opens]
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': We have an emergency!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The students dropped out of the sky!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Slow down. What happened?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I cast a spell for our field trip to Cloudsdale, but my magic just failed.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': We barely caught everypony in time!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm glad you're all okay, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, Starlight. Maybe you did your spell wrong. Let's take a look.
:[thud]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I didn't drop that book.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sarcastically] Maybe you did your spell wrong?
:[thud]
:'''Rarity''': Ow!
:[door opens]
:'''Fluttershy''': Rarity ran into the door.
:'''Rarity''': [sobbing] My magic is go-o-o-one! I even had to use my ''hooves'' to coif my tail!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Still think there's nothing to worry about?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This doesn't make any sense. Magic can't just disappear. Something has to be causing this.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Um, didn't we learn in class about a creature that eats magic? Ter, Tee... Tir-something?
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Tirek!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?
:[door opens]
:'''Spike''': [gagging]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Spike, what's wrong?
:'''Spike''': [gagging, belches, sighs] Thanks. I've never had a letter get stuck before. It's from Princess Celestia! We've all been called to an emergency meeting in Canterlot! Look!
:[magic fizzles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Pretty sure I know what it's about.

:'''Princess Celestia''': Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing. Spells going wrong. Potions not working.
:'''Princess Luna''': Even raising the moon has become difficult. Are there similar troubles in Ponyville?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We experienced it first-hoof.
:'''Princess Cadance''': It's the same in my kingdom. The Crystal Heart seems safe for now, but I worry if this continues.
:[door opens]
:'''"Special Delivery"''': [panting] Letter for the princess from Star Swirl the Bearded!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Ah! It is even more terrible than we feared! Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Princess Celestia''': Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days. First, unicorn magic and spells will fail.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's what's happening now.
:'''Princess Celestia''': On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities.
:'''Fluttershy''': [gasps] Oh, no!
:'''Princess Celestia''': And finally, magical artifacts will stop working. When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world will be gone forever!
:[ponies gasp]
:'''Princess Cadance''': But why is this happening now?
:'''Princess Luna''': That's the worst part. We have no idea.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Has anypony checked on Tirek?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You mean the big, red, scary centaur who eats magic? Why would we wa— Ohhhh. Riiiiight.
:'''Princess Celestia''': If he has found some way to escape his prison or work from within it, he could be responsible for this.
:'''Princess Luna''': That is the best explanation so far. Somepony should investigate.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We'll go.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. Not without us, you wo— Wait. Did you say "we"?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I've finally learned that it's okay to count on your friends for help. Um, you do want to come, right?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Uh, duh!
:'''Princess Celestia''': Thank you, all. We will search for ways to protect Equestria in your absence.
:'''Princess Luna''': Be careful. Tartarus has changed since you were there. It now holds many dangerous creatures, and you won't be able to rely on your magic.
:'''Applejack''': With her friends by her side, she won't have to.

:[door opens]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Okay. I left you my lesson plan, all my student files, and my annotated syllabus notes. If anything goes wrong, get Celestia.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Got it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Maybe I should just close the school and send my students home.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': [sighs] Would you go save Equestria already?
:'''Spike''': Okay. Cozy packed us all up for a trip to bad guy central.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Don't forget the sandwiches. I marked whose is whose, just in case. [whispering, to Spike] Starlight can't stand mustard.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': That's so sweet of you, Cozy. But Twilight has asked me to stay here to run the school.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh. I thought that after what happened last time—
:'''Spike''': Once she's survived Discord, anything else is a piece of cake.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [whimpers]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Plus, she'll have you to help her.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, golly, yes! I promise I'll be the best assistant ever! Come on. We can start working on your substitute headmare plans right now, if you like.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Wow. Uh, okay.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': See? Nothing to worry about. Tell me there's nothing to worry about.

:[doors open]
:[students chattering]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Good morning, friendship students! I know we're all sad Professor Sparkle is away. But don't worry, because she left me in charge to do things just the way she would.
:'''Gallus''': Uh, I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare.
:'''Cozy Glow''': She was, but she left me this note. [reading] "I have to go. Twilight needs my help. I know the school is in good hooves with you, Cozy." [giggles] Isn't that sweet? We won't let Starlight down, will we?
:[students agreeing]
:'''Smolder''': It's just kind of weird, isn't it?
:'''Cozy Glow''': I don't know what you mean.
:'''Smolder''': Like, why'd she change her mind? Why did Starlight write a note instead of saying goodbye to us herself? Doesn't make any sense.
:[students murmuring]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [giggles] Oh, Smolder, you forget. We're not scheming dragons. We're ponies. Sounds like somecreature needs to do a little extra friendship homework.
:[students laughing]
:'''Smolder''': [growls]
:'''Yona''': Yak not pony either! If Smolder get homework, Yona get homework.
:'''Ocellus''': Me, too!
:'''Sandbar''': I'm in!
:'''Silverstream''': Yeah! [laughs] Homework party!
:[beat]
:'''Gallus''': [groans] Fine.
:'''Cozy Glow''': What loyalty. Professor Rainbow Dash would be so proud. You are such good friends. You all are. And I'm grateful because it will be awfully hard running a whole school alone. Can I count on each of you to help me?
:[students cheering]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Thank you so much! It's just like our professors taught us. Together, we can get through anything!

:[Fly-ders buzzing]
:'''Rarity''': [blows]
:[smack!]
:'''Rarity''': Ow! Ugh! I have had it with these horrible flies! [whines] I miss my magic!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Have you tried using your tail to shoo them away?
:'''Rarity''': [gasps] Bite your tongue! It's for decorative purposes only!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Hey! I didn't know we packed green cupcakes.
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, we didn't. They must've gone bad without magic to keep them cold.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': "Magic" this, "magic" that. We don't need magic to go on a little hike.
:[thunder]
:[rain falling]
:'''Rarity''': You were saying?
:'''Applejack''': You just need to think more like Earth ponies, y'all. Granny's "Apple Core No-Bite-No-More"! That'll keep the flies off.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [sniffs] Ugh! It smells just like it looks!
:'''Fluttershy''': Even if our food's spoiled, these blueberries are still good to eat.
:'''Spike''': Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': I can't stop that storm by myself, but I can still help!
:[thunder]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I think we have all the magic we need right here. Not that I don't want to get it back. Heh. Let's go!

:[students chattering]
:'''"Citrine Spark"''': Cozy Glow baked our class cupcakes today!
:'''"Berry Bliss"''': And she made all of us friendship bracelets!
:'''"Patty Peppermint"''': She's the nicest pony I've ever met. I'm so glad she's headmare!
:'''Sandbar''': Uh, ''temporary'' headmare? Right, guys?
:'''"Citrine Spark"''': Oh, oh, of course. But if Twilight takes her time coming back, I won't mind.
:[students laughing]

:[door opens]
:'''Silverstream''': Finally! We thought you forgot about study club.
:'''Sandbar''': Sorry I'm late. Cozy Glow gave our class tickets to a Sapphire Shores concert in Ponyville tonight.
:'''Gallus''': You get the feeling Cozy's trying too hard to make us like her?
:'''Ocellus''': Or maybe she just wants to help us keep our minds off of how scary it is that magic's disappearing.
:'''Smolder''': I don't trust her. What's she up to behind those big eyes and bouncy curls?
:[clattering]
:'''Yona''': And why Cozy pony coming out catacombs so late at night?
:'''Gallus''': Let's go ask her.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': This is the only door to Tartarus. The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape.
:'''Applejack''': Let me guess. You got bad news, too?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Last time I was here, I had to use magic to get in. And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone by yesterday's sunset.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Maybe he was wrong.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunts]
:[magic fizzles]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [sighs]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't worry, Twilight. I got this.
:[knock, knock]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Free pizza delivery!
:[beat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Huh. Always worked before. Oh, well.
:'''Applejack''': Did any of y'all pack somethin' that could ''actually'' help?
:'''Rarity''': These all do magic, but not the kind we're looking for, I'm afraid.
:'''Spike''': How about this?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': The Key of Unfettered Entrance! Where did you find this, Spike?
:'''Spike''': In your bag. Cozy Glow must've packed it for you.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': She really did think of everything.
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, what does it do?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It can magically open any door. And since artifacts like this haven't lost their power yet...
:[whirring]
:[gears clicking]
:[cranking sounds]
:[shatter!]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I guess it only works once.
:[door slams]

:[cockatrice hisses]
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': Cockatrice!
:'''Rarity''': Do something, Fluttershy!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Don't look at it! It'll turn you to stone!
:[cockatrice hisses]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I don't feel like stone.
:[boing, boing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Unless it's really bouncy stone.
:'''Fluttershy''': I think he lost his magic, too. All the creatures here must have.
:[low growling]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Star Swirl said that would happen on the second day.
:'''Spike''': I know it should make me feel safer, but it just makes me sad. We gotta fix this!

:[door opens]
:[chair creaks]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Where is Princess Twilight?!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, golly. She's away on a quest. I'm watching the school for her.
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Magic is failing across our land, and she left a ''foal'' in charge of this facility?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Yes, sir! Is there anything I can do for you?
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': That won't be necessary. Twilight's folly stops here. As of now, ''I'' am headstallion. And I have quite a few changes to make.

:'''Pinkie Pie''': If all these monsters lost their magic, then getting past Cerberus should be easy-peasy!
:[loud thudding]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Look out!
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [scream]
:'''Fluttershy''': I'll talk to him.
:'''Cerberus''': [growls]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, excuse me, puppy?
:'''Cerberus''': [snorts]
:'''Fluttershy''': You're a very good guard dog. Yes, you are. But, um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on Tirek.
:'''Cerberus''': [slurping]
:'''Applejack''': That looks like a yes.
:[splash!]
:'''Rarity''': I'll get you a towel, darling.
:'''Fluttershy''': [giggling]

:'''Lord Tirek''': The Princess of Friendship here for a visit. What have I done to earn the honor of your company?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We want answers, Tirek. Magic is disappearing from Equestria.
:'''Lord Tirek''': I know. What a waste of such... [slurping] ...mmmm, delicious power.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': So you ''are'' behind this!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Silly filly, if I had all of that magic, you think I'd still be locked up in here? But I might know something about it...

:'''Cozy Glow''': What are you doing?! Those are Twilight's student files!
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': These aren't. Not anymore. With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together. Twilight has endangered us all by skipping off on friendship trips while these dangerous creatures run loose.
:'''Cozy Glow''': You don't think ''they're'' the reason magic is disappearing, do you?
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Yes, and I came to warn Twilight. But since she is gone, it falls to me to protect you foals from these monsters.
:'''Young Six''': [murmuring]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Did you hear something?
:'''Cozy Glow''': It sounded like it came from over there!
:[door creaks]
:'''Young Six''': [grunt]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': You again. As I suspected.
:[magic surging]
:'''Young Six''': [scream]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': From now on, this school is pony-only! As nature intended.

:[door opens]
:[thud]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Since you refuse to explain your plot against Equestria and return the magic you stole, you will stay here while I summon your guardians to take you home.
:'''Sandbar''': Wait! You were right about them from the beginning, Chancellor. I see that now.
:'''Smolder''': What are you saying?!
:'''Silverstream''': Sandbar?!
:'''Sandbar''': I don't want anything to do with ''creatures'' that could threaten Equestria!
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Wisely put, colt.
:[magic surging]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Everypony will come to their senses eventually.
:[door closes]

:[thud]
:[thud]
:[multiple thuds]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [yawns]
:[clatter!]
:'''Apple Bloom''': What in tarnation?!
:'''Sandbar''': Sorry. I ran out of apples. I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble. Chancellor Neighsay locked them up.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Huh? I thought Cozy Glow was in charge.
:'''Sandbar''': Not anymore. But you guys are good buddies. If you can convince her to distract Neighsay, I can break out my friends. Will you help me?
:'''Apple Bloom''': Do mulberries have seeds?
:[beat]
:'''Apple Bloom''': That's a yes.

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Where is Equestria's magic going, Tirek? What's making it disappear?
:'''Lord Tirek''': If you let me out, I'm sure it will jog my memory. What do you say? I scratch your back, you scratch mine?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': How about you tell us what you know or you'll be stuck here forever, because we're out of magic keys and nopony can open the door?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, dear. I hadn't thought of that.
:'''Spike''': We're just as trapped as Tirek?
:'''Lord Tirek''': [chuckles] What a pity. Well, for you. Sweet revenge for me. It seems my little protégé's plan worked after all.
:'''Mane Six''' and '''Spike''': [gasp]
:'''Applejack''': Which little protégé?
:'''Lord Tirek''': Oh, we've never met. We're pen pals. Each letter had so many questions about draining magic.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': And you answered them?!
:'''Lord Tirek''': I was bored. So I simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction.
:[thud]
:'''Fluttershy''': Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name? I mean, since we're stuck here anyway?
:'''Lord Tirek''': Oh, why not? The irony is too perfect. Her name is...

:'''Sandbar''': Cozy Glow! I-I could've sworn I saw her come down this way when she left her office.
:[clang!]
:'''Sandbar''' and '''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [gasp]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Enjoying yourself in there, Starlight? I'm sorry I had to push you in. But what else could I do? You were going to ruin all my plans.
:'''Sandbar''' and '''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [gasp]
:'''Cozy Glow''': You might get some company soon, if I can't make that annoying Neighsay ''back off!'' [inhales, exhales] All this magic needs time to drain from Equestria before my vortex sucks it to another realm. [giggles] Three days can sure seem like forever, huh? You know, you ponies got it all wrong. Friendship isn't magic. Friendship is ''power!'' With Twilight and her lackeys out of my way, all of Equestria will bow to ''me!'' The future Empress of Friendship! [maniacal laughter]

:[Previously on My Little Pony]

:'''Princess Celestia''': Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!

:'''Cozy Glow''': Didn't we learn about a creature that eats magic?

:'''Princess Luna''': Somepony should investigate.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We'll go.

:'''Gallus''': I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare.

:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together.

:'''Sandbar''': I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble.

:'''Lord Tirek''': It seems my little protégé's plan worked after all.

:'''Cozy Glow''': The future Empress of Friendship! [maniacal laughter]

:{{squarebrackets|[[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]]}}

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Cozy Glow is behind all of this?!
:'''Lord Tirek''': [laughs] I'm not usually a fan of ponies, but draining your precious world of magic so she could trap the six of you was inspiring! [laughs, coughs]
:'''Spike''': Um, there's ''seven'' of us.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I knew we shouldn't have left!
:'''Applejack''': But Starlight's in charge at the school. If anypony can stop Cozy Glow, it's her.
:'''Lord Tirek''': Cozy Glow outsmarted the six of you! I doubt this Starlight stands a chance! [coughs]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We have to get out of here. Her students can't handle Cozy on their own.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Then I guess we'll just have to bust our way out! [yells]
:[clang!]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [groans] That didn't work. [groans]
:'''Rarity''': Not everything can be solved with brute force. We need magic to escape.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Maybe there's a way to get out without magic. Like a secret lever or a secret button or a secret admirer who knows a secret about you but is all, "Your secret's safe with me because I put it in Tartarus and I have a key!"
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'm afraid not. The most powerful villains and monsters of all time are trapped here. And without our magic, so are we.
:'''Cerberus''': [whimpers, slurps]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Unless... These creatures might be losing their magical powers, but there's still a magic that makes up what they are. Maybe we can borrow some of that.
:[cockatrice hisses]

:[knocking on door]
:[door opens]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Uh, excuse me? Um, Chancellor Neighsay?
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': You might as well get used to calling me Headstallion Neighsay. I plan to be here for quite some time.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Gee, it sure is a relief to have somepony in charge, what with the magical crisis going on. And we're all so grateful to you for taking care of those... non-ponies. But doesn't the EEA need you?
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': What the EEA needs is somepony to protect this school from the threats at Equestria's borders instead of gallivanting off on adventures beyond them.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Twilight didn't just run off willy-nilly. She left me in charge. I'm her right-hoof mare!
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Another in a long list of mistakes the Princess of Friendship has made. Rest assured, from now on, this school shall be run according to strict EEA guidelines.
:[door opens]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': The way it always should've been.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Well, that sounds just peachy—
:[door closes]
:'''Cozy Glow''': ...''Headstallion Neighsay''.

:'''Sweetie Belle''': Cozy Glow did all of this? How? Why?
:'''Apple Bloom''': I don't know. But come on, y'all. We gotta get Starlight out of there before she comes back.
:'''Sandbar''': Wait!
:[shimmering]
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [screams]
:'''Scootaloo''': Sweetie Belle!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Help!
:'''Apple Bloom''': That's gotta be what's suckin' up all the magic in Equestria.
:'''Sandbar''': But if that's true, then Twilight and the others went to Tartarus for nothing. And if all of Equestria's magic's getting sucked up in there, there's no way for them to get back!
:'''Scootaloo''': We need to get help!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': But Starlight's trapped here, and there's no way to get word to Celestia or anypony else!
:'''Apple Bloom''': I guess we're on our own.

:'''Gallus''': [grunting]
:[door rattling]
:[thud]
:'''Smolder''': Still locked, huh?
:'''Gallus''': We gotta at least ''try'' to get out.
:'''Ocellus''': Why? If Sandbar's turned his back on us, every other pony probably has, too.
:'''Yona''': Sandbar not turn his back! Sandbar is our friend!
:'''Smolder''': Uh, did you miss the part where he said he didn't want anything to do with us?
:'''Silverstream''': Maybe he just said that so one of us could be free to snoop around and figure out what's going on.
:[lock unlatches]
:'''Sandbar''': I dunno. That sounds too clever for a ''pony'' to come up with.
:'''Yona''': [gasps, laughs] Yona knew Sandbar was still our friend!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': We all are.
:'''Scootaloo''': Except for Cozy Glow. That pony is ''not'' who we thought she was.
:'''Apple Bloom''': She's the one draining magic out of Equestria!
:'''Young Six sans Sandbar''': What?!
:'''Sandbar''': We'll explain on the way. But right now, we gotta get to get to Chancellor Neighsay.
:'''Gallus''': Huh?
:'''Sandbar''': I know he doesn't like non-ponies. But if we tell him what's going on, he'll help.

:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': I am sure you are all concerned about the magic situation. But I want to assure you that this institution is safe, despite the absence of your headmare. As your new headstallion, let me be the first to say that the reign of Princess Twilight is over! From now on, this school will adhere to EEA doctrine, as it should have from the start!
:[students murmuring]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [claps] Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay, for that rousing speech. I know you're a stallion who truly believes what you say. And when you say this school will be run according to EEA doctrine, I know you mean it. ''And'' when you say there won't be any more lessons from the Princess of Friendship at the School of Friendship, I guess you mean that, too.
:[students murmuring]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': That's not exactly what—
:'''Cozy Glow''': ''But'' Twilight decided to run her school outside of the EEA guidelines. And even though you tried to stop her, Princesses Celestia and Luna trusted her enough to support her.
:[students murmuring]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Well, I-I wouldn't say that—
:'''Cozy Glow''': So, since I know you mean what you say, my question is really for the students. Are we going to give the pony who already tried to wreck Twilight's school once another chance to do it?
:[students dissenting]
:'''Cozy Glow''': I guess things will have to stay the way Twilight wants them. Which includes leaving ''me'' in charge.
:[students shouting]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': This—! I can—! Just—!
:[door opens]
:'''Sandbar''': Okay. So maybe we need a new plan.

:[chains rattling]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, oh, not too tight. We don't want to hurt the Chancellor.
:[padlock clanking]
:'''Cozy Glow''': I'm sure Twilight will know what to do with him when she gets back. Now, back to class, everyone. We let the EEA disrupt our friendship studies long enough.
:[doors close]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': [grunting] Why are you doing this? I thought you wanted to have somepony in charge of the school.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, I do. You just aren't the pony I had in mind.
:[clank!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': I can't very well have the EEA running the school if ''I'' want to run it myself. Of course, that's just the beginning. You see, if there's one thing I've learned here, it's that friendship is the most powerful thing there is. And as headmare of the School of Friendship, nopony will have more friends than me! Making me the most powerful pony in Equestria! [maniacal laughter]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': [gulps]

:[door opens]
:'''Cozy Glow''': [giggling evilly]
:'''Scootaloo''': Hey, Cozy Glow! What's so funny?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Are you just happy to be running the school?
:'''Cozy Glow''': Oh, I'm just keeping Twilight's seat warm.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Still, it's pretty impressive.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Is there anything we can do to help?
:'''Scootaloo''': We can hang out with you all day if you want.
:'''Cozy Glow''': You know, there ''is'' something I need help with.
:'''Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [cheer]
:[door opens]
:[thudding]
:[rattling]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Oh, wonderful. I suppose you've all come to gloat?
:'''Silverstream''': Actually, we've come to undo all these chains and free you!
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': But... But why?
:'''Yona''': Now that nasty pony met even nastier pony, maybe nasty pony not be so nasty.
:[screech!]
:[chains rattling]
:[crash!]
:'''Sandbar''': Also, we'd kind of like to stop Cozy before she drains all the magic from Equestria.
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': She's behind that as well? I must get word to Celestia and Luna.
:'''Sandbar''': How? Without magic, it'll take forever to get to them.
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': While it's true that unicorns have lost their ability to cast spells, the most potent magic in Equestria is housed in our... artifacts. The EEA medallion allows me to travel throughout Equestria. Its magic worked when I chained you up. Perhaps it still has enough to send me to the princesses.
:[magic surging]
:'''Ocellus''': I hope he makes it.
:'''Smolder''': I hope he doesn't come back and lock us up again.
:'''Gallus''': ''If'' he comes back.
:'''Silverstream''': Everything's gonna be fine! Twilight and the others are probably already on their way!

:'''Cerberus''': [growls, whimpers]
:'''Fluttershy''': Um, are you sure there's magic in Cerberus? Clarissa the pig has two tails, and while her singing voice is lovely, I don't think it's magical.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': We need to try everything if we want to get out of here.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': I don't know. Tartarus isn't so bad. I could hang out here for a while!
:[flames roaring]
:[crunch!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Eh. Maybe not forever though.
:'''Lord Tirek''': But that is just what it will be! If my protégé has followed my instructions, by sunset tonight, every last vestige of Equestrian magic will disappear into the ether forever!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Have you even thought about what losing magic would mean?
:'''Lord Tirek''': It means the six of you will be trapped here! Like me!
:'''Spike''': ''Seven!''
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Exactly. It means you're trapped here. Forever. With ''us''.
:[beat]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Uhhhh... I hadn't thought of it like that.
:'''Spike''': So, what do we do, Twilight?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Dash and Applejack nearly have Cerberus tired out. If Rarity pitches in, I think they can get him to sit still long enough to try what I have in mind.
:'''Fluttershy''': I'm sure I can get the other monsters to help. [whispering, to Spike] Besides, I would never call them monsters.
:'''Spike''': What about Tirek? He's probably got some magic, too, right?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Leave him to me.
:'''Rarity''': [to Cerberus] Down!
:'''Cerberus''': [low growl]
:'''Fluttershy''': Okay, everyone! Time to show Equestria that you aren't monsters! You're wonderful, mystical creatures!
:'''Pinkie Pie''':
::I know it's not your birthday, so
::You get a party, even though
::We'll sing and dance from one to ten
::And then we'll do it all again!
:[blows] More tea, Princess Pudding Rock? [high-pitched voice] "Oh! Don't mind if I do!" [laughs] I can do this all eternity.
:'''Lord Tirek''': ''Fine!'' I'll help you leave! Just please stop!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Tirek's in!

:'''Apple Bloom''': It's just so excitin' to have a foal our age runnin' things. We should have an ice cream social every day!
:'''Cozy Glow''': That's a splendid idea, Apple Bloom. But to tell you the truth, the thing I need help with most is cleaning.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Say no more. Just take us around the school and show us everything you want cleaned.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Well, actually, you could start right in here.
:'''Scootaloo''': It looks pretty clean already.
:[door slams]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Do you three think you can fool me?! I know a diversion when I see it!

:[rocks crumbling]
:'''Yona''': Uh, why pony lead us back down here?
:'''Sandbar''': We obviously can't handle Cozy on our own. But we can't just sit around and wait for help. So, there's one more prisoner I think we should free.
:'''Silverstream''': Ooh! I guess Starlight! Is it Starlight?
:'''Yona''': Counselor pony, come out! We need help with nasty pony!
:'''Sandbar''': She can't talk to us from in there. We'll have to figure a way to get her out.
:'''Gallus''': Hey! This is just like chapter twelve in "Kanthaka<!--as transcribed on iTunes-->'s Facts and Artifacts" from Twilight's class!
:[beat]
:'''Gallus''': What? I've been studying. Finals are coming up, you know?
:'''Ocellus''': Actually, I remember that, too! Cozy must've linked these artifacts to act like a mystical magnet, attracting all the magic in Equestria into that orb.
:'''Smolder''': So, we can shut it down by yanking one of these things out, right?
:'''Ocellus''': Sure, though that would probably cause a magical feedback loop and destroy the whole school!
:'''Cozy Glow''': Destroy the School of Friendship?! Oh, dear! Chancellor Neighsay was wrong about a lot of things, but I guess he was right about all of you!

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': All right. Is everypony ready?
:'''Rarity''': [to Cerberus] Sit! Good! [to Twilight Sparkle] I can't say for how much longer.
:[cymbals crashing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': All eternity!
:'''Lord Tirek''': Yes, by all means, please! Just get on with it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [clears throat]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': There's your cue, you evil centaur, you.
:[magic surging]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [grunting]
:[magic zap]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That's it! I think it's working!
:[doors creaking]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Come on! I don't know how long I can hold it!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': [to Cerberus] Good boy!
:'''Fluttershy''': [to creatures] Bye, friends. Hopefully, we'll be able to turn you all back into your normal, wonderful selves soon.
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [to Lord Tirek] Thanks for the assist, your redness!
:[zoom!]
:[doors creaking]
:[thud!]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Yay! Twilight did it!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I couldn't have done it without all your help.
:'''Rarity''': I'm not sure we did!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No!
:'''Applejack''': Tirek said all of Equestria's magic would be gone at sunset.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Without magic, there's no way we'll get back to the school in time!
:'''Fluttershy''': What does that mean?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': It means... we've failed!

:'''Cozy Glow''': After everything Twilight's done for you, why would you want to destroy her school?
:'''Gallus''': ''We'' don't! ''You're'' the one using these artifacts to drain magic from Equestria!
:'''Cozy Glow''': ''Me?!'' We all just saw ''you'' with your claws all over them! [gasps] It all makes sense. These creatures want magic gone from Equestria because it's the only thing ponies have that they don't!
:'''Ocellus''': Technically, there's a magical component when Silverstream and I transform.
:'''Yona''': And Yona's friends' friendship is magic! Twilight said!
:'''Cozy Glow''': And you repay her by sending her to Tartarus on a wild goose chase so you could destroy everything she built! [gasps] They've even trapped Starlight in that-that thing! We have to defend this school!
:[students shouting]
:'''Sandbar''': No! No, don't listen to her!
:[Young Six and students shouting and grunting]
:[thud!]
:'''Gallus''': [screams]
:'''Smolder''': Gallus!
:'''Rest of Young Six''': [grunting]
:[cracking]
:[vortex swirling]
:'''"Citrine Spark"''': They just sacrificed themselves trying to save their friend. Professor Dash always said there's nothing more loyal than that. Shouldn't ''we'' try to save ''them''?
:'''Cozy Glow''': They brought this on themselves. There's nothing we can do.
:'''"Berry Bliss"''': That doesn't seem very generous. Or kind.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Yeah, yeah. The Elements of Harmony are very important. They're just not applicable in every circumstance. And with magic gone from Equestria, I'm not even sure the Tree of Harmony will be as helpful as it once was.
:[shimmering]
:'''Cozy Glow''': What's happening?!
:'''"Berry Bliss"''': They're glowing like the Elements! I think the Tree of Harmony saved them!
:'''Gallus''': Guess our friendship is pretty magical after all.
:'''Ocellus''': Hurry! Grab the artifacts!
:'''Silverstream''': Um, didn't you say that could destroy the school?
:'''Ocellus''': But if we don't try, we could lose magic forever!
:'''Sandbar''': You all better get clear!
:[students screaming]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Wait! Where are you going?! ''Stoooooop!''
:[magic surging]
:[boom!]

:[thud]

:[teleportation zap]

:[students panicking]
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Yona''': [laughs] Counselor pony—!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, it's nice to see you, too.
:'''Ocellus''': I guess magic is back.
:'''Cozy Glow''': You've ruined everything! Now Twilight and her ridiculous friends can escape from Tartarus!
:[teleportation zap]
:'''Cozy Glow''': I mean... Yay! All my friends are safe!
:'''Applejack''': You can drop the act, Cozy Glow! Your pen pal Tirek told us all about how he helped you suck up all that magic!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': But I still don't understand why.
:'''Cozy Glow''': [growls] Why?! Because friendship is power! You might be the Princess of Friendship, but as headmare of this school, I can collect even more friends than ''you''!
:[students murmuring]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': ''You're'' the one who doesn't get it, Cozy. Friendship ''is'' powerful, but power isn't why you make friends. I'm sorry I couldn't teach you that.
:'''Gallus''': Well, you taught us.
:'''Silverstream''': You can't let one bad apple make you think you failed.
:'''Sandbar''': And we never could've stopped her if we hadn't learned what you taught us about friendship.
:'''Cozy Glow''': Honesty? Loyalty? Generosity? Blah-blah-blah! I can make more friends without using any of them! And if I can't do it here, I'll do it somewhere else!
:'''"Patty Peppermint"''': Yeah... I don't think so!

:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': [sighs] I'm glad you're back in charge of the School of Friendship, Princess.
:[door opens]
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': It's clear to me now that there is nopony better suited for the job.
:'''Spike''': [belching]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What's going on?
:'''Silverstream''': Hi, Headmare Twilight! We're just practicing for graduation!
:'''Spike''': [belching]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Graduation?
:'''Gallus''': Now that we've saved Equestria, we figure we're done with school.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''' and '''Chancellor Neighsay''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Saving Equestria is nice, but I'm afraid it'll take more than one semester to learn all there is to know about friendship.
:'''Spike''': [belches] Told ya.
:'''Young Six''': Awwww...
:'''Chancellor Neighsay''': Your headmare is right. I thought friendship was something only ponies should share with each other. But you all taught me how wrong I was. I suppose true friendship can take a lifetime to understand.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': If it were easy to learn, we wouldn't need a school.
:[crash!]
:'''Apple Bloom''': [yelps] We held her off as long as we could!
:'''Scootaloo''': But she locked us in this closet!
:'''Sweetie Belle''': What happened?! Is everything all right?! Where's Cozy Glow?!
:'''All except Cutie Mark Crusaders''': [laugh]
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Everything worked out just fine.
:'''Princess Celestia''': As for Cozy Glow, I can assure you — where she's going, she won't be causing any more trouble.

:'''Cerberus''': [whimpers]
:'''Lord Tirek''': Of course it's boring here now! But at least you're not in a cage!
:[magic surging]
:[clang!]
:'''Cozy Glow''': Hey, neighbor. Wanna be friends?
:[ominous music]
